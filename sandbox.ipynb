      "['The Great Gatsby\\n', 'By F. Scott Fitzgerald\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her;\\n', 'If you can bounce high, bounce for her too,  \\n', 'Till she cry \"Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover,\\n', 'I must have you!\"\\n', \"-THOMAS PARKE D'INVILLIERS\\n\", '\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 1\\n', 'In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave \\n', \"me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind\\n\", 'ever since.\\n', '\\n', '\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\" he told me,\\n', '\"just remember that all the people in this world haven\\'t had\\n', 'the advantages that you\\'ve had.\"\\n', '\\n', \"He didn't say any more but we've always been unusually\\n\", 'communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he \\n', \"meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I'm inclined\\n\", 'to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up\\n', 'many curious natures to me and also made me the victim \\n', 'of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to \\n', 'detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a \\n', 'normal person, and so it came about that in college I was \\n', 'unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy \\n', 'to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men. Most of the confidences\\n', 'were unsought-frequently I have feigned sleep,\\n', 'preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some \\n', 'unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering\\n', 'on the horizon-for the intimate revelations of young\\n', 'men or at least the terms in which they express them are \\n', 'usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions. \\n', 'Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still \\n', 'a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my\\n', 'father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense\\n', 'of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at \\n', 'birth.\\n', '\\n', 'And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to \\n', 'the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded \\n', 'on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point \\n', \"I don't care what it's founded on. When I came back from\\n\", 'the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in \\n', 'uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted\\n', 'no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses\\n', 'into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his \\n', 'name to this book, was exempt from my reaction-Gatsby\\n', 'who represented everything for which I have an unaffected\\n', 'scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful\\n', 'gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, \\n', 'some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he \\n', 'were related to one of those intricate machines that register \\n', 'earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness \\n', 'had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which \\n', \"is dignified under the name of the 'creative temperament'-it\\n\", 'was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness\\n', 'such as I have never found in any other person and which \\n', 'it is not likely I shall ever find again. No-Gatsby turned\\n', 'out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what \\n', 'foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily \\n', 'closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded\\n', 'elations of men.\\n', '\\n', 'My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in \\n', 'this middle-western city for three generations. The\\n', 'Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that\\n', \"we're descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual\\n\", \"founder of my line was my grandfather's brother who\\n\", 'came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and \\n', 'started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries\\n', 'on today.\\n', '\\n', \"I never saw this great-uncle but I'm supposed to look\\n\", 'like him-with special reference to the rather hard-boiled\\n', \"painting that hangs in Father's office. I graduated from New\\n\", 'Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, \\n', 'and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration\\n', 'known as the Great War. I enjoyed the counter-raid\\n', 'so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being the \\n', 'warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like \\n', 'the ragged edge of the universe-so I decided to go east and\\n', 'learn the bond business. Everybody I knew was in the bond \\n', 'business so I supposed it could support one more single \\n', 'man. All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were \\n', 'choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, \"Why-yees\"\\n', 'with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance\\n', 'me for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently,\\n', 'I thought, in the spring of twenty-two.\\n', '\\n', 'The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was \\n', 'a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns \\n', 'and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested\\n', 'that we take a house together in a commuting town\\n', 'it sounded like a great idea. He found the house, a weather \\n', 'beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the \\n', 'last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went\\n', 'out to the country alone. I had a dog, at least I had him for a\\n', 'few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish \\n', 'woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered\\n', 'Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove.\\n', '\\n', 'It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man,\\n', 'more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.\\n', '\"How do you get to West Egg village?\" he asked helplessly.\\n', '\\n', 'I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I \\n', 'was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually\\n', 'conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood.\\n', '\\n', 'And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves \\n', 'growing on the trees-just as things grow in fast movies-I\\n', 'had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over \\n', 'again with the summer.\\n', '\\n', 'There was so much to read for one thing and so much \\n', 'fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving\\n', 'air. I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and\\n', 'investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and \\n', 'gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold \\n', 'the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas\\n', 'knew. And I had the high intention of reading many\\n', 'other books besides. I was rather literary in college-one\\n', 'year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials \\n', \"for the 'Yale News'-and now I was going to bring back all\\n\", 'such things into my life and become again that most limited \\n', \"of all specialists, the 'well-rounded man.' This isn't just an\\n\", 'epigram-life is much more successfully looked at from a\\n', 'single window, after all.\\n', '\\n', 'It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a\\n', 'house in one of the strangest communities in North America.\\n', 'It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself\\n', 'due east of New York and where there are, among other \\n', 'natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land. Twenty \\n', 'miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in \\n', 'contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into \\n', 'the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western \\n', 'Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. \\n', 'They are not perfect ovals-like the egg in the Columbus\\n', 'story they are both crushed flat at the contact end-but\\n', 'their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual \\n', 'confusion to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a \\n', 'more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every \\n', 'particular except shape and size.\\n', '\\n', 'I lived at West Egg, the-well, the less fashionable of the\\n', 'two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre\\n', 'and not a little sinister contrast between them. My\\n', 'house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the \\n', 'Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented \\n', 'for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right \\n', 'was a colossal affair by any standard-it was a factual imitation\\n', 'of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on\\n', 'one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a \\n', 'marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn \\n', \"and garden. It was Gatsby's mansion. Or rather, as I didn't\\n\", 'know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman\\n', 'of that name. My own house was an eye-sore, but it\\n', 'was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had\\n', \"a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and\\n\", 'the consoling proximity of millionaires-all for eighty dollars a month.\\n', '\\n', 'Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable \\n', 'East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the \\n', 'summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to \\n', 'have dinner with the Tom Buchanans. Daisy was my second \\n', \"cousin once removed and I'd known Tom in college. And\\n\", 'just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago.\\n', '\\n', 'Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, \\n', 'had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played \\n', 'football at New Haven-a national figure in a way, one of\\n', 'those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at \\n', 'twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax.\\n', 'His family were enormously wealthy-even in college\\n', 'his freedom with money was a matter for reproach-but\\n', \"now he'd left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather\\n\", \"took your breath away: for instance he'd brought down a\\n\", 'string of polo ponies from Lake Forest. It was hard to realize\\n', 'that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that.\\n', '\\n', \"Why they came east I don't know. They had spent a year\\n\", 'in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here \\n', 'and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were \\n', 'rich together. This was a permanent move, said Daisy over \\n', \"the telephone, but I didn't believe it-I had no sight into\\n\", \"Daisy's heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking\\n\", 'a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some\\n', 'irrecoverable football game.\\n', '\\n', 'And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I\\n', 'drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely\\n', 'knew at all. Their house was even more elaborate than I\\n', 'expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion\\n', 'overlooking the bay. The lawn started at the beach and\\n', 'ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping \\n', 'over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens-finally\\n', 'when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright\\n', 'vines as though from the momentum of its run. The front \\n', 'was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with \\n', 'reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, \\n', 'and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his \\n', 'legs apart on the front porch.\\n', '\\n', 'He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he \\n', 'was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard \\n', 'mouth and a supercilious manner. Two shining, arrogant \\n', 'eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him \\n', 'the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. Not \\n', 'even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide \\n', 'the enormous power of that body-he seemed to fill those\\n', 'glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you \\n', 'could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder \\n', 'moved under his thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous\\n', 'leverage-a cruel body.\\n', '\\n', 'His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression\\n', 'of fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of\\n', 'paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked-and\\n', 'there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts.\\n', '\"Now, don\\'t think my opinion on these matters is final,\"\\n', 'he seemed to say, \"just because I\\'m stronger and more of a\\n', 'man than you are.\" We were in the same Senior Society, and\\n', 'while we were never intimate I always had the impression \\n', 'that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with \\n', 'some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\\n', '\\n', 'We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ve got a nice place here,\" he said, his eyes flashing about\\n', 'restlessly.\\n', '\\n', 'Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat \\n', 'hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken \\n', 'Italian garden, a half acre of deep pungent roses and a\\n', 'snub-nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore.\\n', '\\n', '\"It belonged to Demaine the oil man.\" He turned me\\n', 'around again, politely and abruptly. \"We\\'ll go inside.\"\\n', 'We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored\\n', 'space, fragilely bound into the house by French\\n', 'windows at either end. The windows were ajar and gleaming \\n', 'white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a \\n', 'little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, \\n', 'blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, \\n', 'twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the \\n', 'ceiling-and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making\\n', 'a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.\\n', '\\n', 'The only completely stationary object in the room was an\\n', 'enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed \\n', 'up as though upon an anchored balloon. They were both \\n', 'in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if \\n', 'they had just been blown back in after a short flight around \\n', 'the house. I must have stood for a few moments listening to \\n', 'the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture\\n', 'on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan\\n', 'shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about \\n', 'the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young \\n', 'women ballooned slowly to the floor.\\n', '\\n', 'The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was \\n', 'extended full length at her end of the divan, completely \\n', 'motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were \\n', 'balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. If \\n', 'she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of \\n', 'it-indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology\\n', 'for having disturbed her by coming in. The other girl, Daisy,\\n', 'made an attempt to rise-she leaned slightly forward with a\\n', 'conscientious expression-then she laughed, an absurd,\\n', 'charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward\\n', 'into the room.\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'m p-paralyzed with happiness.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, \\n', 'and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, \\n', 'promising that there was no one in the world she so much \\n', 'wanted to see. That was a way she had. She hinted in a murmur\\n', \"that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker. (I've\\n\", \"heard it said that Daisy's murmur was only to make people\\n\", 'lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less \\n', 'charming.)\\n', '\\n', \"At any rate Miss Baker's lips fluttered, she nodded at me\\n\", 'almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back \\n', 'again-the object she was balancing had obviously tottered\\n', 'a little and given her something of a fright. Again a sort of \\n', 'apology arose to my lips. Almost any exhibition of complete\\n', 'self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me.\\n', '\\n', 'I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions\\n', 'in her low, thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that\\n', 'the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement\\n', 'of notes that will never be played again. Her face was\\n', 'sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a \\n', 'bright passionate mouth-but there was an excitement in\\n', 'her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to \\n', 'forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise\\n', 'that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since\\n', 'and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour.\\n', '\\n', 'I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on \\n', 'my way east and how a dozen people had sent their love \\n', 'through me.\\n', '\\n', '\"Do they miss me?\" she cried ecstatically.\\n', '\\n', '\"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear\\n', \"wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent\\n\", 'wail all night along the North Shore.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"How gorgeous! Let\\'s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!\" Then\\n', 'she added irrelevantly, \"You ought to see the baby.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'d like to.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"She\\'s asleep. She\\'s two years old. Haven\\'t you ever seen\\n', 'her?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Never.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, you ought to see her. She\\'s--\"\\n', '\\n', 'Tom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about \\n', 'the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.\\n', '\\n', '\"What you doing, Nick?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'m a bond man.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Who with?\"\\n', '\\n', 'I told him.\\n', '\\n', '\"Never heard of them,\" he remarked decisively.\\n', '\\n', 'This annoyed me.\\n', '\\n', '\"You will,\" I answered shortly. \"You will if you stay in the East.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, I\\'ll stay in the East, don\\'t you worry,\" he said, glancing\\n', 'at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for\\n', 'something more. \"I\\'d be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else.\"\\n', '\\n', 'At this point Miss Baker said \"Absolutely!\" with such\\n', 'suddenness that I started-it was the first word she uttered\\n', 'since I came into the room. Evidently it surprised her as \\n', 'much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, \\n', 'deft movements stood up into the room.\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'m stiff,\" she complained, \"I\\'ve been lying on that sofa\\n', 'for as long as I can remember.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Don\\'t look at me,\" Daisy retorted. \"I\\'ve been trying to get\\n', 'you to New York all afternoon.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, thanks,\" said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in\\n', 'from the pantry, \"I\\'m absolutely in training.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Her host looked at her incredulously.\\n', '\\n', '\"You are!\" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in\\n', 'the bottom of a glass. \"How you ever get anything done is\\n', 'beyond me.\"\\n', '\\n', \"I looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she 'got\\n\", \"done.' I enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted\\n\", 'girl, with an erect carriage which she accentuated\\n', 'by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young \\n', 'cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with \\n', 'polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented\\n', 'face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a\\n', 'picture of her, somewhere before.\\n', '\\n', '\"You live in West Egg,\" she remarked contemptuously. \"I\\n', 'know somebody there.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t know a single--\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You must know Gatsby.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Gatsby?\" demanded Daisy. \"What Gatsby?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner \\n', 'was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under\\n', 'mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as\\n', 'though he were moving a checker to another square.\\n', '\\n', 'Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips\\n', 'the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored \\n', 'porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered \\n', 'on the table in the diminished wind.\\n', '\\n', '\"Why CANDLES?\" objected Daisy, frowning. She\\n', 'snapped them out with her fingers. \"In two weeks it\\'ll be the\\n', 'longest day in the year.\" She looked at us all radiantly. \"Do\\n', 'you always watch for the longest day of the year and then \\n', 'miss it? I always watch for the longest day in the year and \\n', 'then miss it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting\\n', 'down at the table as if she were getting into bed.\\n', '\\n', '\"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What\\'ll we plan?\" She turned to\\n', 'me helplessly. \"What do people plan?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed\\n', 'expression on her little finger.\\n', '\\n', '\"Look\" she complained. \"I hurt it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'We all looked-the knuckle was black and blue.\\n', '\\n', '\"You did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"I know you didn\\'t\\n', \"mean to but you DID do it. That's what I get for marrying\\n\", 'a brute of a man, a great big hulking physical specimen of \\n', 'a--\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I hate that word hulking,\" objected Tom crossly, \"even in\\n', 'kidding.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Hulking,\" insisted Daisy.\\n', '\\n', 'Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively\\n', 'and with a bantering inconsequence that was never\\n', 'quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and \\n', 'their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire. They were \\n', 'here-and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite\\n', 'pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They\\n', 'knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later \\n', 'the evening too would be over and casually put away. It was \\n', 'sharply different from the West where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close in a continually\\n', 'disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of \\n', 'the moment itself.\\n', '\\n', '\"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" I confessed on my\\n', 'second glass of corky but rather impressive claret. \"Can\\'t\\n', 'you talk about crops or something?\"\\n', '\\n', 'I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was \\n', 'taken up in an unexpected way.\\n', '\\n', '\"Civilization\\'s going to pieces,\" broke out Tom violently.\\n', '\"I\\'ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you\\n', 'read \\'The Rise of the Coloured Empires\\' by this man Goddard?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Why, no,\" I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, it\\'s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The\\n', \"idea is if we don't look out the white race will be-will be utterly\\n\", 'submerged. It\\'s all scientific stuff; it\\'s been proved.\"\\n', '\"Tom\\'s getting very profound,\" said Daisy with an expression\\n', 'of unthoughtful sadness. \"He reads deep books with\\n', 'long words in them. What was that word we--\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, these books are all scientific,\" insisted Tom, glancing\\n', 'at her impatiently. \"This fellow has worked out the whole\\n', \"thing. It's up to us who are the dominant race to watch out\\n\", 'or these other races will have control of things.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"We\\'ve got to beat them down,\" whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun.\\n', '\\n', '\"You ought to live in California-\" began Miss Baker but\\n', 'Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\\n', '\\n', '\"This idea is that we\\'re Nordics. I am, and you are and\\n', 'you are and--\" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included\\n', 'Daisy with a slight nod and she winked at me again.\\n', '\"-and we\\'ve produced all the things that go to make\\n', 'civilization-oh, science and art and all that. Do you see?\"\\n', '\\n', 'There was something pathetic in his concentration as if \\n', 'his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to \\n', 'him any more. When, almost immediately, the telephone \\n', 'rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon \\n', 'the momentary interruption and leaned toward me.\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ll tell you a family secret,\" she whispered enthusiastically.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s about the butler\\'s nose. Do you want to hear about\\n', 'the butler\\'s nose?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That\\'s why I came over tonight.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, he wasn\\'t always a butler; he used to be the silver\\n', 'polisher for some people in New York that had a silver\\n', 'service for two hundred people. He had to polish it from \\n', 'morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose--\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Things went from bad to worse,\" suggested Miss Baker.\\n', '\\n', '\"Yes. Things went from bad to worse until finally he had\\n', 'to give up his position.\"\\n', '\\n', 'For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affec -\\n', 'tion upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward \\n', 'breathlessly as I listened-then the glow faded, each light\\n', 'deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a \\n', 'pleasant street at dusk.\\n', '\\n', 'The butler came back and murmured something close to \\n', \"Tom's ear whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair\\n\", 'and without a word went inside. As if his absence quickened \\n', 'something within her Daisy leaned forward again, her voice \\n', 'glowing and singing.\\n', '\\n', '\"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a-of\\n', 'a rose, an absolute rose. Doesn\\'t he?\" She turned to Miss\\n', 'Baker for confirmation. \"An absolute rose?\"\\n', 'This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She \\n', 'was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from \\n', 'her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed \\n', 'in one of those breathless, thrilling words. Then suddenly \\n', 'she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and\\n', 'went into the house.\\n', '\\n', 'Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously\\n', 'devoid of meaning. I was about to speak when she sat\\n', 'up alertly and said \"Sh!\" in a warning voice. A subdued\\n', 'impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and\\n', 'Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear. The \\n', 'murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, \\n', 'mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.\\n', '\\n', '\"This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor--\" I said.\\n', '\\n', '\"Don\\'t talk. I want to hear what happens.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Is something happening?\" I inquired innocently.\\n', '\\n', '\"You mean to say you don\\'t know?\" said Miss Baker,\\n', 'honestly surprised. \"I thought everybody knew.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Why--\" she said hesitantly, \"Tom\\'s got some woman\\n', 'in New York.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Got some woman?\" I repeated blankly.\\n', '\\n', 'Miss Baker nodded.\\n', '\\n', '\"She might have the decency not to telephone him at din -\\n', 'ner-time. Don\\'t you think?\"\\n', '\\n', 'Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the \\n', 'flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom \\n', 'and Daisy were back at the table.\\n', '\\n', '\"It couldn\\'t be helped!\" cried Daisy with tense gayety.\\n', 'She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and \\n', 'then at me and continued: \"I looked outdoors for a minute\\n', \"and it's very romantic outdoors. There's a bird on the lawn\\n\", 'that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or\\n', 'White Star Line. He\\'s singing away--\" her voice sang \"--It\\'s\\n', 'romantic, isn\\'t it, Tom?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Very romantic,\" he said, and then miserably to me: \"If\\n', \"it's light enough after dinner I want to take you down to the\\n\", 'stables.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook \\n', 'her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact \\n', 'all subjects, vanished into air. Among the broken fragments \\n', 'of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being \\n', 'lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look \\n', \"squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes. I couldn't\\n\", 'guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even \\n', 'Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy \\n', \"skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guest's shrill\\n\", 'metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the\\n', 'situation might have seemed intriguing-my own instinct\\n', 'was to telephone immediately for the police.\\n', '\\n', 'The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again.\\n', 'Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between\\n', 'them strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a \\n', 'perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly\\n', 'interested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain\\n', 'of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In its deep \\n', 'gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\\n', '\\n', 'Daisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely\\n', 'shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet\\n', 'dusk. I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked \\n', 'what I thought would be some sedative questions about her \\n', 'little girl.\\n', '\\n', '\"We don\\'t know each other very well, Nick,\" she said\\n', 'suddenly. \"Even if we are cousins. You didn\\'t come to my\\n', 'wedding.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I wasn\\'t back from the war.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That\\'s true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I\\'ve had a very bad\\n', 'time, Nick, and I\\'m pretty cynical about everything.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn't say\\n\", 'any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the \\n', 'subject of her daughter.\\n', '\\n', '\"I suppose she talks, and-eats, and everything.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; let me\\n', 'tell you what I said when she was born. Would you like to \\n', 'hear?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Very much.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'ll show you how I\\'ve gotten to feel about-things.\\n', 'Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows \\n', 'where. I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned \\n', 'feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a \\n', 'girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away \\n', 'and wept. \"All right,\" I said, \"I\\'m glad it\\'s a girl. And I hope\\n', \"she'll be a fool-that's the best thing a girl can be in this\\n\", 'world, a beautiful little fool.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"You see I think everything\\'s terrible anyhow,\" she went\\n', 'on in a convinced way. \"Everybody thinks so-the most advanced\\n', \"people. And I KNOW. I've been everywhere and seen\\n\", 'everything and done everything.\" Her eyes flashed around\\n', \"her in a defiant way, rather like Tom's, and she laughed with\\n\", 'thrilling scorn. \"Sophisticated-God, I\\'m sophisticated!\"\\n', '\\n', 'The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my\\n', 'attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she\\n', 'had said. It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening \\n', 'had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion\\n', 'from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she\\n', 'looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if \\n', 'she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished \\n', 'secret society to which she and Tom belonged.\\n', '\\n', 'Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and \\n', 'Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read \\n', \"aloud to him from the 'Saturday Evening Post'-the words,\\n\", 'murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing\\n', 'tune. The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on\\n', 'the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper \\n', 'as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her \\n', 'arms.\\n', '\\n', 'When we came in she held us silent for a moment with \\n', 'a lifted hand.\\n', '\\n', '\"To be continued,\" she said, tossing the magazine on the\\n', 'table, \"in our very next issue.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her \\n', 'knee, and she stood up.\\n', '\\n', '\"Ten o\\'clock,\" she remarked, apparently finding the time\\n', 'on the ceiling. \"Time for this good girl to go to bed.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Jordan\\'s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explained\\n', 'Daisy, \"over at Westchester.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh,-you\\'re JORdan Baker.\"\\n', '\\n', 'I knew now why her face was familiar-its pleasing contemptuous\\n', 'expression had looked out at me from many\\n', 'rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and \\n', 'Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard some story of her\\n', 'too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had\\n', 'forgotten long ago.\\n', '\\n', '\"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won\\'t\\n', \"you.'\\n\", '\\n', '\"If you\\'ll get up.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Of course you will,\" confirmed Daisy. \"In fact I think\\n', \"I'll arrange a marriage.

Besides,\\n', \"Nick's going to look after her, aren't you, Nick? She's\\n\", 'going to spend lots of week-ends out here this summer. I \\n', 'think the home influence will be very good for her.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\\n', '\\n', '\"Is she from New York?\" I asked quickly.\\n', '\\n', '\"From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together\\n', 'there. Our beautiful white--\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the\\n', 'veranda?\" demanded Tom suddenly.\\n', '\\n', '\"Did I?\" She looked at me. \"I can\\'t seem to remember, but I\\n', \"think we talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I'm sure we did.\\n\", 'It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know--\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Don\\'t believe everything you hear, Nick,\" he advised\\n', 'me.\\n', '\\n', 'I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few \\n', 'minutes later I got up to go home.

We\\n\", 'heard you were engaged to a girl out West.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That\\'s right,\" corroborated Tom kindly. \"We heard that\\n', 'you were engaged.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s libel. I\\'m too poor.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But we heard it,\" insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening\\n', 'up again in a flower-like way. \"We heard it from three\\n', 'people so it must be true.\"\\n', '\\n', \"Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn't\\n\", 'even vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published \\n', \"the banns was one of the reasons I had come east.

It seemed to me that the thing for\\n', 'Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms-but\\n', 'apparently there were no such intentions in her head. As for \\n', \"Tom, the fact that he 'had some woman in New York' was\\n\", 'really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a\\n', 'book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale \\n', 'ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished \\n', 'his peremptory heart.\\n', '\\n', 'Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and \\n', 'in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat \\n', 'out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West \\n', 'Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an \\n', 'abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had blown off, \\n', 'leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees \\n', 'and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth \\n', 'blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered\\n', 'across the moonlight and turning my head to watch\\n', 'it I saw that I was not alone-fifty feet away a figure had\\n', \"emerged from the shadow of my neighbor's mansion and\\n\", 'was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the \\n', 'silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely movements\\n', 'and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn\\n', 'suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to\\n', 'determine what share was his of our local heavens.\\n', '\\n', 'I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him \\n', 'at dinner, and that would do for an introduction. But I \\n', \"didn't call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he\\n\", 'was content to be alone-he stretched out his arms toward\\n', 'the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I \\n', 'could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced \\n', 'seaward-and distinguished nothing except a single green\\n', 'light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of \\n', 'a dock. When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished,\\n', 'and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness.\\n', '\\n', 'Chapter 2\\n', '\\n', 'About half way between West Egg and New York the \\n', 'motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside \\n', 'it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain \\n', 'desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes-a fantastic\\n', 'farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and \\n', 'grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and \\n', 'chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcen -\\n', 'dent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling \\n', 'through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars \\n', 'crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and \\n', 'comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up \\n', 'with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which \\n', 'screens their obscure operations from your sight.\\n', '\\n', 'But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust\\n', 'which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, \\n', 'the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J. \\n', 'Eckleburg are blue and gigantic-their retinas are one yard\\n', 'high. They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of \\n', 'enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent \\n', 'nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there \\n', 'to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then \\n', 'sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them \\n', 'and moved away. But his eyes, dimmed a little by many \\n', 'paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over\\n', 'the solemn dumping ground.\\n', '\\n', 'The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul \\n', 'river, and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, \\n', 'the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal \\n', 'scene for as long as half an hour. There is always a halt there \\n', 'of at least a minute and it was because of this that I first met \\n', \"Tom Buchanan's mistress.\\n\", '\\n', 'The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he \\n', 'was known. His acquaintances resented the fact that he \\n', 'turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her \\n', 'at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he \\n', 'knew. Though I was curious to see her I had no desire to \\n', 'meet her-but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the\\n', 'train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps \\n', 'he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally \\n', 'forced me from the car.\\n', '\\n', '\"We\\'re getting off!\" he insisted. \"I want you to meet my\\n', 'girl.\"\\n', '\\n', \"I think he'd tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his\\n\", 'determination to have my company bordered on violence. \\n', 'The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon \\n', 'I had nothing better to do.\\n', '\\n', 'I followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence \\n', 'and we walked back a hundred yards along the road un -\\n', \"der Doctor Eckleburg's persistent stare. The only building\\n\", 'in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge \\n', 'of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering \\n', 'to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing. One of the three \\n', 'shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night \\n', 'restaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a\\n', 'garage-Repairs. GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and\\n', 'Sold-and I followed Tom inside.\\n', '\\n', 'The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible\\n', 'was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched\\n', 'in a dim corner. It had occurred to me that this shadow of \\n', 'a garage must be a blind and that sumptuous and romantic \\n', 'apartments were concealed overhead when the proprietor \\n', 'himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands \\n', 'on a piece of waste. He was a blonde, spiritless man, anaemic,\\n', 'and faintly handsome. When he saw us a damp gleam\\n', 'of hope sprang into his light blue eyes.\\n', '\\n', '\"Hello, Wilson, old man,\" said Tom, slapping him jovially\\n', 'on the shoulder. \"How\\'s business?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I can\\'t complain,\" answered Wilson unconvincingly. \"When are\\n', 'you going to sell me that car?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Next week; I\\'ve got my man working on it now.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Works pretty slow, don\\'t he?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"No, he doesn\\'t,\" said Tom coldly. \"And if you feel that way\\n', 'about it, maybe I\\'d better sell it somewhere else after all.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I don\\'t mean that,\" explained Wilson quickly. \"I just\\n', 'meant--\"\\n', '\\n', 'His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around \\n', 'the garage. Then I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment\\n', 'the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light\\n', 'from the office door. She was in the middle thirties, and \\n', 'faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as \\n', 'some women can. Her face, above a spotted dress of dark \\n', 'blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty \\n', 'but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her\\n', 'as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering.\\n', '\\n', 'She smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he \\n', 'were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in \\n', 'the eye. Then she wet her lips and without turning around \\n', 'spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:\\n', '\\n', '\"Get some chairs, why don\\'t you, so somebody can sit\\n', 'down.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, sure,\" agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the\\n', 'little office, mingling immediately with the cement color of \\n', 'the walls. A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his \\n', 'pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity-except his\\n', 'wife, who moved close to Tom.\\n', '\\n', '\"I want to see you,\" said Tom intently. \"Get on the next\\n', 'train.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"All right.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'ll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She nodded and moved away from him just as George \\n', 'Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door.\\n', 'We waited for her down the road and out of sight. It was \\n', 'a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny \\n', 'Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the rail -\\n', 'road track.\\n', '\\n', '\"Terrible place, isn\\'t it,\" said Tom, exchanging a frown\\n', 'with Doctor Eckleburg.\\n', '\\n', '\"Awful.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It does her good to get away.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Doesn\\'t her husband object?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Wilson? He thinks she goes to see her sister in New\\n', 'York. He\\'s so dumb he doesn\\'t know he\\'s alive.\"\\n', '\\n', 'So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together\\n', 'to New York-or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson\\n', 'sat discreetly in another car. Tom deferred that much to \\n', 'the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the \\n', 'train.\\n', '\\n', 'She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin\\n', 'which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom\\n', 'helped her to the platform in New York. At the news-stand \\n', \"she bought a copy of 'Town Tattle' and a moving-picture\\n\", 'magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream \\n', 'and a small flask of perfume. Upstairs, in the solemn echoing\\n', 'drive she let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected\\n', 'a new one, lavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in \\n', 'this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing\\n', 'sunshine. But immediately she turned sharply from the\\n', 'window and leaning forward tapped on the front glass.\\n', '\\n', '\"I want to get one of those dogs,\" she said earnestly. \"I\\n', \"want to get one for the apartment. They're nice to have-a\\n\", 'dog.\"\\n', '\\n', 'We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd\\n', 'resemblance to John D. Rockefeller. In a basket, swung from\\n', 'his neck, cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an\\n', 'indeterminate breed.\\n', '\\n', '\"What kind are they?\" asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as he\\n', 'came to the taxi-window.\\n', '\\n', '\"All kinds. What kind do you want, lady?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'d like to get one of those police dogs; I don\\'t suppose\\n', 'you got that kind?\"\\n', '\\n', 'The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in\\n', 'his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the \\n', 'neck.\\n', '\\n', '\"That\\'s no police dog,\" said Tom.\\n', '\\n', '\"No, it\\'s not exactly a polICE dog,\" said the man with\\n', 'disappointment in his voice. \"It\\'s more of an airedale.\" He\\n', 'passed his hand over the brown wash-rag of a back. \"Look\\n', \"at that coat. Some coat. That's a dog that'll never bother you\\n\", 'with catching cold.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"I think it\\'s cute,\" said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. \"How\\n', 'much is it?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"That dog?\" He looked at it admiringly. \"That dog will cost\\n', 'you ten dollars.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The airedale-undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned\\n', 'in it somewhere though its feet were startlingly\\n', \"white-changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson's\\n\", 'lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture.\\n', '\\n', '\"Is it a boy or a girl?\" she asked delicately.\\n', '\\n', '\"That dog? That dog\\'s a boy.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s a bitch,\" said Tom decisively. \"Here\\'s your money. Go\\n', 'and buy ten more dogs with it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost \\n', \"pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn't\\n\", 'have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn \\n', 'the corner.\\n', '\\n', '\"Hold on,\" I said, \"I have to leave you here.\"\\n', '\"No, you don\\'t,\" interposed Tom quickly. \"Myrtle\\'ll be\\n', \"hurt if you don't come up to the apartment. Won't you,\\n\", 'Myrtle?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Come on,\" she urged. \"I\\'ll telephone my sister Catherine.\\n', \"She's said to be very beautiful by people who ought\\n\", 'to know.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Well, I\\'d like to, but--\"\\n', '\\n', 'We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the \\n', 'West Hundreds. At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice \\n', 'in a long white cake of apartment houses. Throwing a regal \\n', 'homecoming glance around the neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson\\n', 'gathered up her dog and her other purchases and went\\n', 'haughtily in.\\n', '\\n', '\"I\\'m going to have the McKees come up,\" she announced\\n', 'as we rose in the elevator. \"And of course I got to call up my\\n', 'sister, too.\"\\n', '\\n', 'The apartment was on the top floor-a small living\\n', 'room, a small dining room, a small bedroom and a bath. \\n', 'The living room was crowded to the doors with a set of\\n', 'tapestried furniture entirely too large for it so that to move\\n', 'about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies \\n', 'swinging in the gardens of Versailles. The only picture was \\n', 'an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on \\n', 'a blurred rock. Looked at from a distance however the hen \\n', 'resolved itself into a bonnet and the countenance of a stout \\n', 'old lady beamed down into the room. Several old copies of \\n', \"'Town Tattle' lay on the table together with a copy of 'Simon\\n\", \"Called Peter' and some of the small scandal magazines of\\n\", 'Broadway. Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog. A \\n', 'reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some \\n', 'milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large \\n', 'hard dog biscuits-one of which decomposed apathetically\\n', 'in the saucer of milk all afternoon. Meanwhile Tom brought\\n', 'out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door.\\n', '\\n', 'I have been drunk just twice in my life and the second \\n', 'time was that afternoon so everything that happened has a \\n', \"dim hazy cast over it although until after eight o'clock the\\n\", \"apartment was full of cheerful sun. Sitting on Tom's lap\\n\", 'Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then \\n', 'there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at the \\n', 'drug store on the corner. When I came back they had\\n', 'disappeared so I sat down discreetly in the living room and read\\n', \"a chapter of 'Simon Called Peter'-either it was terrible stuff\\n\", \"or the whiskey distorted things because it didn't make any\\n\", 'sense to me.\\n', '\\n', 'Just as Tom and Myrtle-after the first drink Mrs. Wilson\\n', 'and I called each other by our first names-reappeared,\\n', 'company commenced to arrive at the apartment door.\\n', '\\n', 'The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about \\n', 'thirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion \\n', 'powdered milky white. Her eyebrows had been plucked and \\n', 'then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts \\n', 'of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave \\n', 'a blurred air to her face. When she moved about there was \\n', 'an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled\\n', 'up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a\\n', 'proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the \\n', 'furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when I asked \\n', 'her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud \\n', 'and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.\\n', '\\n', 'Mr. McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below. \\n', 'He had just shaved for there was a white spot of lather on\\n', 'his cheekbone and he was most respectful in his greeting to \\n', 'everyone in the room. He informed me that he was in the \\n', \"'artistic game' and I gathered later that he was a photographer\\n\", \"and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson's\\n\", 'mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His \\n', 'wife was shrill, languid, handsome and horrible. She told \\n', 'me with pride that her husband had photographed her a \\n', 'hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married.\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before and\\n', 'was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of\\n', 'cream colored chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as \\n', 'she swept about the room. With the influence of the dress \\n', 'her personality had also undergone a change. The intense \\n', 'vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted\\n', 'into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures,\\n', 'her assertions became more violently affected moment by \\n', 'moment and as she expanded the room grew smaller around \\n', 'her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking \\n', 'pivot through the smoky air.\\n', '\\n', '\"My dear,\" she told her sister in a high mincing shout,\\n', '\"most of these fellas will cheat you every time. All they think\\n', 'of is money. I had a woman up here last week to look at my \\n', \"feet and when she gave me the bill you'd of thought she had\\n\", 'my appendicitus out.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"What was the name of the woman?\" asked Mrs. McKee.\\n', '\\n', '\"Mrs. Eberhardt. She goes around looking at people\\'s feet\\n', 'in their own homes.\"\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\"I like your dress,\" remarked Mrs. McKee, \"I think it\\'s\\n', 'adorable.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain.\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'s just a crazy old thing,\" she said. \"I just slip it on sometimes\\n', 'when I don\\'t care what I look like.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,\"\\n', 'pursued Mrs. McKee. \"If Chester could only get you in that\\n', 'pose I think he could make something of it.\"\\n', '\\n', 'We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who removed a \\n', 'strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with \\n', 'a brilliant smile. Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his \\n', 'head on one side and then moved his hand back and forth \\n', 'slowly in front of his face.\\n', '\\n', '\"I should change the light,\" he said after a moment. \"I\\'d\\n', \"like to bring out the modelling of the features.

If I was them I'd get a divorce and get married\\n\", 'to each other right away.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Doesn\\'t she like Wilson either?\"\\n', '\\n', 'The answer to this was unexpected. It came from Myrtle \\n', 'who had overheard the question and it was violent and obscene.\\n', '\\n', '\"You see?\" cried Catherine triumphantly. She lowered her\\n', 'voice again. \"It\\'s really his wife that\\'s keeping them apart.\\n', 'She\\'s a Catholic and they don\\'t believe in divorce.\"\\n', '\\n', 'Daisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the \\n', 'elaborateness of the lie.\\n', '\\n', '\"When they do get married,\" continued Catherine,\\n', '\"they\\'re going west to live for a while until it blows over.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"It\\'d be more discreet to go to Europe.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Oh, do you like Europe?\" she exclaimed surprisingly. \"I\\n', 'just got back from Monte Carlo.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Really.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Just last year.

I never was any more crazy about\\n', 'him than I was about that man there.\"\\n', '\\n', 'She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at \\n', 'me accusingly. I tried to show by my expression that I had \\n', 'played no part in her past.\\n', '\\n', '\"The only CRAZY I was was when I married him. I knew\\n', \"right away I made a mistake.

I wanted to get out and \\n', 'walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but \\n', 'each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild strident\\n', 'argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into\\n', 'my chair. Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows \\n', 'must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the \\n', 'casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, \\n', 'looking up and wondering.

When we came \\n', 'into the station he was next to me and his white shirt-front \\n', \"pressed against my arm-and so I told him I'd have to call\\n\", 'a policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when \\n', \"I got into a taxi with him I didn't hardly know I wasn't getting\\n\", 'into a subway train.

People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go \\n', 'somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each \\n', 'other, found each other a few feet away. Some time toward \\n', 'midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to \\n', 'face discussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs. Wilson \\n', \"had any right to mention Daisy's name.\\n\", '\\n', '\"Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!\" shouted Mrs. Wilson. \"I\\'ll say it\\n', 'whenever I want to! Daisy!

Mr. McKee awoke from his doze \\n', 'and started in a daze toward the door. When he had gone \\n', 'half way he turned around and stared at the scene-his wife\\n', 'and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled \\n', 'here and there among the crowded furniture with articles \\n', 'of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently\\n', \"and trying to spread a copy of 'Town Tattle' over the\\n\", 'tapestry scenes of Versailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and \\n', 'continued on out the door. Taking my hat from the chandelier\\n', 'I followed.\\n', '\\n', '\"Come to lunch some day,\" he suggested, as we groaned\\n', 'down in the elevator.\\n', '\\n', '\"Where?\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Anywhere.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"Keep your hands off the lever,\" snapped the elevator\\n', 'boy.\\n', '\\n', '\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. McKee with dignity, \"I didn\\'t\\n', 'know I was touching it.\"\\n', '\\n', '\"All right,\" I agreed, \"I\\'ll be glad to.\"\\n', '\\n', '...

At high tide in the afternoon I watched\\n', 'his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the \\n', 'sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats \\n', 'slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts\\n', 'of foam. On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an\\n', 'omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city, between \\n', 'nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station\\n', 'wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all\\n', 'trains. And on Mondays eight servants including an extra \\n', 'gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes \\n', 'and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of \\n', 'the night before.\\n', '\\n', 'Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived \\n', 'from a fruiterer in New York-every Monday these same\\n', 'oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulpless\\n', 'halves.

I was immediately struck by the number of young\\n', 'Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little\\n', 'hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and\\n', 'prosperous Americans.

My voice seemed \\n', 'comunnaturally loud across the garden.\\n', '\\n', '�I thought you might be here,� she responded absently as I \\n', 'came up. �I remembered you lived next door to���\\n', '\\n', 'She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she�d \\n', 'take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin \\n', 'yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps.\\n', '\\n', '�Hello!� they cried together. �Sorry you didn�t win.�\\n', 'That was for the golf tournament. She had lost in the finals\\n', 'the week before.\\n', '\\n', '�You don�t know who we are,� said one of the girls in yellow,\\n', '�but we met you here about a month ago.�\\n', '\\n', '�You�ve dyed your hair since then,� remarked Jordan, and \\n', 'I started but the girls had moved casually on and her remark\\n', 'was addressed to the premature moon, produced like\\n', 'the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer�s basket. With Jordan�s \\n', 'slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps \\n', 'and sauntered about the garden. A tray of cocktails floated \\n', 'at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with \\n', 'the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced \\n', 'to us as Mr. Mumble.\\n', '\\n', '�Do you come to these parties often?� inquired Jordan of \\n', 'the girl beside her.\\n', '\\n', '�The last one was the one I met you at,� answered the girl, \\n', 'in an alert, confident voice. She turned to her companion:\\n', '�Wasn�t it for you, Lucille?�\\n', '\\n', 'It was for Lucille, too.\\n', '\\n', '�I like to come,� Lucille said. �I never care what I do, so \\n', 'I always have a good time. When I was here last I tore my \\n', 'gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address�\\n', 'inside of a week I got a package from Croirier�s with a new\\n', 'evening gown in it.�\\n', '\\n', '�Did you keep it?� asked Jordan.\\n', '\\n', '�Sure I did. I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too \\n', 'big in the bust and had to be altered. It was gas blue with \\n', 'lavender beads. Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.�\\n', '\\n', '�There�s something funny about a fellow that�ll do a thing\\n', 'like that,� said the other girl eagerly. �He doesn�t want any \\n', 'trouble with ANYbody.�\\n', '\\n', '�Who doesn�t?� I inquired.\\n', '\\n', '�Gatsby. Somebody told me���\\n', '\\n', 'The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially.\\n', '\\n', '�Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.�\\n', '\\n', 'A thrill passed over all of us. The three Mr. Mumbles \\n', 'bent forward and listened eagerly.\\n', '\\n', '�I don�t think it�s so much THAT,� argued Lucille skeptically;\\n', '�it�s more that he was a German spy during the war.�\\n', '\\n', 'One of the men nodded in confirmation.\\n', '\\n', '�I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew \\n', 'up with him in Germany,� he assured us positively.\\n', '\\n', '�Oh, no,� said the first girl, �it couldn�t be that, because he \\n', 'was in the American army during the war.� As our credulity \\n', 'switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm. \\n', '�You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody�s looking\\n', 'at him. I�ll bet he killed a man.�\\n', '\\n', 'She narrowed her eyes and shivered. Lucille shivered. \\n', 'We all turned and looked around for Gatsby. It was testimony\\n', 'to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were\\n', 'whispers about him from those who found little that it was \\n', 'necessary to whisper about in this world.\\n', '\\n', 'The first supper�there would be another one after midnight�\\n', 'was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join\\n', 'her own party who were spread around a table on the other \\n', 'side of the garden. There were three married couples and \\n', 'Jordan�s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent \\n', 'innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner \\n', 'or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a \\n', 'greater or lesser degree. Instead of rambling this party had \\n', 'preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the \\n', 'function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside�East\\n', 'Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully\\n', 'on guard against its spectroscopic gayety.\\n', '\\n', '�Let�s get out,� whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful\\n', 'and inappropriate half hour. �This is much too polite for\\n', 'me.�\\n', '\\n', 'We got up, and she explained that we were going to find \\n', 'the host�I had never met him, she said, and it was making \\n', 'me uneasy. The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way.\\n', '\\n', 'The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby \\n', 'was not there. She couldn�t find him from the top of the \\n', 'steps, and he wasn�t on the veranda. On a chance we tried \\n', 'an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library,\\n', 'panelled with carved English oak, and probably\\n', 'transported complete from some ruin overseas.\\n', '\\n', 'A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles\\n', 'was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great\\n', 'table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books.\\n', '\\n', 'As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined\\n', 'Jordan from head to foot.\\n', '\\n', '�What do you think?� he demanded impetuously.\\n', '\\n', '�About what?�\\n', '\\n', 'He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.\\n', '�About that. As a matter of fact you needn�t bother to as\\n', 'certain. I ascertained. They�re real.�\\n', '\\n', '�The books?�\\n', '\\n', 'He nodded.\\n', '\\n', '�Absolutely real�have pages and everything. I thought \\n', 'they�d be a nice durable cardboard. Matter of fact, they�re \\n', 'absolutely real. Pages and�Here! Lemme show you.�\\n', 'Taking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the \\n', 'bookcases and returned with Volume One of the �Stoddard \\n', 'Lectures.�\\n', '\\n', '�See!� he cried triumphantly. �It�s a bona fide piece of \\n', 'printed matter. It fooled me. This fella�s a regular Belasco. \\n', 'It�s a triumph. What thoroughness! What realism! Knew \\n', 'when to stop too�didn�t cut the pages. But what do you \\n', 'want? What do you expect?�\\n', '\\n', 'He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on \\n', 'its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole \\n', 'library was liable to collapse.\\n', '\\n', '�Who brought you?� he demanded. �Or did you just come? \\n', 'I was brought. Most people were brought.�\\n', '\\n', 'Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering.\\n', '\\n', '�I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,� he continued.\\n', '�Mrs. Claud Roosevelt. Do you know her? I met her somewhere\\n', 'last night. I�ve been drunk for about a week now,\\n', 'and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.�\\n', '\\n', '�Has it?�\\n', '\\n', '�A little bit, I think. I can�t tell yet. I�ve only been here an \\n', 'hour. Did I tell you about the books? They�re real. They�re�\\n', '��\\n', '\\n', '�You told us.�\\n', '\\n', 'We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors.\\n', '\\n', 'There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden, \\n', 'old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless\\n', 'circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously,\\n', 'fashionably and keeping in the corners�and a great number\\n', 'of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving\\n', 'the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the \\n', 'traps. By midnight the hilarity had increased. A celebrated \\n', 'tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung \\n', 'in jazz and between the numbers people were doing �stunts� \\n', 'all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter \\n', 'rose toward the summer sky. A pair of stage �twins��who \\n', 'turned out to be the girls in yellow�did a baby act in costume\\n', 'and champagne was served in glasses bigger than\\n', 'finger bowls. The moon had risen higher, and floating in the \\n', 'Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the \\n', 'stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn.\\n', '\\n', 'I was still with Jordan Baker. We were sitting at a table \\n', 'with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave \\n', 'way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter.\\n', 'I was enjoying myself now. I had taken two finger bowls of\\n', 'champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes\\n', 'into something significant, elemental and profound.\\n', '\\n', 'At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and \\n', 'smiled.\\n', '\\n', '�Your face is familiar,� he said, politely. �Weren�t you in\\n', 'the Third Division during the war?�\\n', '\\n', '�Why, yes. I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.�\\n', '\\n', '�I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eighteen.\\n', 'I knew I�d seen you somewhere before.�\\n', '\\n', 'We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages\\n', 'in France. Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told\\n', 'me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to \\n', 'try it out in the morning.\\n', '\\n', '�Want to go with me, old sport? Just near the shore along \\n', 'the Sound.�\\n', '\\n', '�What time?�\\n', '\\n', '�Any time that suits you best.�\\n', '\\n', 'It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan\\n', 'looked around and smiled.\\n', '\\n', '�Having a gay time now?� she inquired.\\n', '\\n', '�Much better.� I turned again to my new acquaintance.\\n', '\\n', '�This is an unusual party for me. I haven�t even seen the \\n', 'host. I live over there��� I waved my hand at the invisible \\n', 'hedge in the distance, �and this man Gatsby sent over his \\n', 'chauffeur with an invitation.�\\n', '\\n', 'For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand.\\n', '\\n', '�I�m Gatsby,� he said suddenly.\\n', '\\n', '�What!� I exclaimed. �Oh, I beg your pardon.�\\n', '\\n', '�I thought you knew, old sport. I�m afraid I�m not a very\\n', 'good host.�\\n', '\\n', 'He smiled understandingly�much more than understandingly.\\n', 'It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of\\n', 'eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or \\n', 'five times in life. It faced�or seemed to face�the whole external\\n', 'world for an instant, and then concentrated on YOU\\n', 'with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood \\n', 'you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed \\n', 'in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured \\n', 'you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your \\n', 'best, you hoped to convey. Precisely at that point it vanished�and\\n', 'I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a\\n', 'year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech \\n', 'just missed being absurd. Some time before he introduced \\n', 'himself I�d got a strong impression that he was picking his \\n', 'words with care. Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified\\n', 'himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that\\n', 'Chicago was calling him on the wire. He excused himself \\n', 'with a small bow that included each of us in turn.\\n', '\\n', '�If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,� he urged \\n', 'me. �Excuse me. I will rejoin you later.�\\n', '\\n', 'When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan�\\n', 'constrained to assure her of my surprise. I had expected \\n', 'that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in \\n', 'his middle years.\\n', '\\n', '�Who is he?� I demanded. �Do you know?�\\n', '\\n', '�He�s just a man named Gatsby.�\\n', '\\n', '�Where is he from, I mean? And what does he do?�\\n', '\\n', '�Now YOU�re started on the subject,� she answered with \\n', 'a wan smile. �Well,�he told me once he was an Oxford \\n', 'man.�\\n', '\\n', 'A dim background started to take shape behind him but \\n', 'at her next remark it faded away.\\n', '\\n', '�However, I don�t believe it.�\\n', '\\n', '�Why not?�\\n', '\\n', '�I don�t know,� she insisted, �I just don�t think he went \\n', 'there.�\\n', '\\n', 'Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl�s �I \\n', 'think he killed a man,� and had the effect of stimulating my \\n', 'curiosity. I would have accepted without question the information\\n', 'that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana\\n', 'or from the lower East Side of New York. That was comprehensible.\\n', '\\n', 'But young men didn�t�at least in my provincial\\n', 'inexperience I believed they didn�t�drift coolly out of nowhere\\n', 'and buy a palace on Long Island Sound.\\n', '\\n', '�Anyhow he gives large parties,� said Jordan, changing \\n', 'the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete. �And I \\n', 'like large parties. They�re so intimate. At small parties there \\n', 'isn�t any privacy.�\\n', '\\n', 'There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the \\n', 'orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of \\n', 'the garden.\\n', '\\n', '�Ladies and gentlemen,� he cried. �At the request of Mr. \\n', 'Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff�s \\n', 'latest work which attracted so much attention at Carnegie \\n', 'Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was \\n', 'a big sensation.� He smiled with jovial condescension and\\n', 'added �Some sensation!� whereupon everybody laughed.\\n', '�The piece is known,� he concluded lustily, �as �Vladimir \\n', 'Tostoff�s Jazz History of the World.� �\\n', '\\n', 'The nature of Mr. Tostoff�s composition eluded me, because\\n', 'just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone\\n', 'on the marble steps and looking from one group to another \\n', 'with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively\\n', 'tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it\\n', 'were trimmed every day. I could see nothing sinister about \\n', 'him. I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped \\n', 'to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he \\n', 'grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When \\n', 'the �Jazz History of the World� was over girls were putting \\n', 'their heads on men�s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial \\n', 'way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men�s \\n', 'arms, even into groups knowing that some one would arrest\\n', 'their falls�but no one swooned backward on Gatsby\\n', 'and no French bob touched Gatsby�s shoulder and no singing\\n', 'quartets were formed with Gatsby�s head for one link.\\n', '\\n', '�I beg your pardon.�\\n', '\\n', 'Gatsby�s butler was suddenly standing beside us.\\n', '\\n', '�Miss Baker?� he inquired. �I beg your pardon but Mr. \\n', 'Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.�\\n', '\\n', '�With me?� she exclaimed in surprise.\\n', '\\n', '�Yes, madame.�\\n', '\\n', 'She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment,\\n', 'and followed the butler toward the house. I noticed that she\\n', 'wore her evening dress, all her dresses, like sports\\n', 'clothes�there was a jauntiness about her movements as if\\n', 'she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, \\n', 'crisp mornings.\\n', '\\n', 'I was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused \\n', 'and intriguing sounds had issued from a long many-windowed\\n', 'room which overhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan�s\\n', 'undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical\\n', 'conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to\\n', 'join him, I went inside.\\n', '\\n', 'The large room was full of people. One of the girls in \\n', 'yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall, \\n', 'red haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in \\n', 'song. She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during \\n', 'the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything\\n', 'was very very sad�she was not only singing, she was\\n', 'weeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she \\n', 'filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric\\n', 'again in a quavering soprano. The tears coursed down\\n', 'her cheeks�not freely, however, for when they came into \\n', 'contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an \\n', 'inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black \\n', 'rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the \\n', 'notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank \\n', 'into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep.\\n', '\\n', '�She had a fight with a man who says he�s her husband,� \\n', 'explained a girl at my elbow.\\n', '\\n', 'I looked around. Most of the remaining women were \\n', 'now having fights with men said to be their husbands. Even \\n', 'Jordan�s party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asunder\\n', 'by dissension. One of the men was talking with curious\\n', 'intensity to a young actress, and his wife after attempting\\n', 'to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent\\n', 'way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks�at \\n', 'intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry \\n', 'diamond, and hissed �You promised!� into his ear.\\n', '\\n', 'The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward \\n', 'men. The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably\\n', 'sober men and their highly indignant wives. The wives were\\n', 'sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices.\\n', '\\n', '�Whenever he sees I�m having a good time he wants to \\n', 'go home.�\\n', '\\n', '�Never heard anything so selfish in my life.�\\n', '\\n', '�We�re always the first ones to leave.�\\n', '\\n', '�So are we.�\\n', '\\n', '�Well, we�re almost the last tonight,� said one of the men \\n', 'sheepishly. �The orchestra left half an hour ago.�\\n', '\\n', 'In spite of the wives� agreement that such malevolence \\n', 'was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle,\\n', 'and both wives were lifted kicking into the night.\\n', '\\n', 'As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library \\n', 'opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together.\\n', '\\n', 'He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his \\n', 'manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people \\n', 'approached him to say goodbye.\\n', '\\n', 'Jordan�s party were calling impatiently to her from the \\n', 'porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands.\\n', '\\n', '�I�ve just heard the most amazing thing,� she whispered.\\n', '\\n', '�How long were we in there?�\\n', '\\n', '�Why,�about an hour.�\\n', '\\n', '�It was�simply amazing,� she repeated abstractedly. �But \\n', 'I swore I wouldn�t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.� She \\n', 'yawned gracefully in my face. �Please come and see me�. \\n', 'Phone book�. Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney How -\\n', 'ard�.

I wanted to explain that I�d hunted for\\n', 'him early in the evening and to apologize for not having \\n', 'known him in the garden.\\n', '\\n', '�Don�t mention it,� he enjoined me eagerly. �Don�t give it \\n', 'another thought, old sport.� The familiar expression held no \\n', 'more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed \\n', 'my shoulder. �And don�t forget we�re going up in the hydroplane\\n', 'tomorrow morning at nine o�clock.�\\n', '\\n', 'Then the butler, behind his shoulder:\\n', '\\n', '�Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.�\\n', '\\n', '�All right, in a minute.

Good night.�\\n', '\\n', 'But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was \\n', 'not quite over.

In the ditch beside\\n', 'the road, right side up but violently shorn of one wheel,\\n', 'rested a new coup� which had left Gatsby�s drive not two \\n', 'minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment\\n', 'of the wheel which was now getting considerable\\n', 'attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However, as \\n', 'they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant \\n', 'din from those in the rear had been audible for some time \\n', 'and added to the already violent confusion of the scene.\\n', '\\n', 'A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck \\n', 'and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the \\n', 'car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a\\n', 'pleasant, puzzled way.\\n', '\\n', '�See!� he explained. �It went in the ditch.�\\n', '\\n', 'The fact was infinitely astonishing to him�and\\n', 'I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the\\n', 'man�it was the late patron of Gatsby�s library.\\n', '\\n', '�How�d it happen?�\\n', '\\n', 'He shrugged his shoulders.\\n', '\\n', '�I know nothing whatever about mechanics,� he said decisively.\\n', '\\n', '�But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?�\\n', '\\n', '�Don�t ask me,� said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the \\n', 'whole matter. �I know very little about driving�next to \\n', 'nothing. It happened, and that�s all I know.�\\n', '\\n', '�Well, if you�re a poor driver you oughtn�t to try driving \\n', 'at night.�\\n', '\\n', '�But I wasn�t even trying,� he explained indignantly, �I \\n', 'wasn�t even trying.�\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\\n', '\\n', '�Do you want to commit suicide?�\\n', '\\n', '�You�re lucky it was just a wheel!

The crowd�it was now a crowd�stepped back involuntarily\\n', 'and when the door had opened wide there was\\n', 'a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale \\n', 'dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively\\n', 'at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\\n', '\\n', 'Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by \\n', 'the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood \\n', 'swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the \\n', 'duster.\\n', '\\n', '�Wha�s matter?� he inquired calmly. �Did we run outa \\n', 'gas?�\\n', '\\n', '�Look!�\\n', '\\n', 'Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel�he \\n', 'stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though \\n', 'he suspected that it had dropped from the sky.\\n', '\\n', '�It came off,� some one explained.\\n', '\\n', 'He nodded.\\n', '\\n', '�At first I din� notice we�d stopped.�\\n', '\\n', 'A pause.

I glanced \\n', 'back once. A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby�s \\n', 'house, making the night fine as before and surviving the \\n', 'laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden. A sudden\\n', 'emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and\\n', 'the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure\\n', 'of the host who stood on the porch, his hand up in a\\n', 'formal gesture of farewell.\\n', '\\n', 'Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given \\n', 'the impression that the events of three nights several weeks \\n', 'apart were all that absorbed me. On the contrary they were \\n', 'merely casual events in a crowded summer and, until much \\n', 'later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs.\\n', '\\n', 'Most of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun \\n', 'threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white \\n', 'chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust. I knew the \\n', 'other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names \\n', 'and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on \\n', 'little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I even \\n', 'had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and\\n', 'worked in the accounting department, but her brother began\\n', 'throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went\\n', 'on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away.\\n', '\\n', 'I took dinner usually at the Yale Club�for some reason \\n', 'it was the gloomiest event of my day�and then I went upstairs\\n', 'to the library and studied investments and securities\\n', 'for a conscientious hour. There were generally a few rioters \\n', 'around but they never came into the library so it was a good \\n', 'place to work. After that, if the night was mellow I strolled \\n', 'down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel and \\n', 'over Thirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\\n', '\\n', 'I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of\\n', 'it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of \\n', 'men and women and machines gives to the restless eye. I \\n', 'liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women\\n', 'from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was\\n', 'going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know \\n', 'or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to \\n', 'their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they \\n', 'turned and smiled back at me before they faded through \\n', 'a door into warm darkness. At the enchanted metropolitan\\n', 'twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and\\n', 'felt it in others�poor young clerks who loitered in front of \\n', 'windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant \\n', 'dinner�young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant\\n', 'moments of night and life.\\n', '\\n', 'Again at eight o�clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties\\n', 'were five deep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the\\n', 'theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart.

Imagining\\n', 'that I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their \\n', 'intimate excitement, I wished them well.\\n', '\\n', 'For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer\\n', 'I found her again. At first I was flattered to go\\n', 'places with her because she was a golf champion and every\\n', 'one knew her name. Then it was something more. I\\n', 'wasn�t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity. \\n', 'The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed\\n', 'something�most affectations conceal something\\n', 'eventually, even though they don�t in the beginning�and \\n', 'one day I found what it was. When we were on a house-party\\n', 'together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out\\n', 'in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it�and \\n', 'suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded \\n', 'me that night at Daisy�s. At her first big golf tournament \\n', 'there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers�a\\n', 'suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the\\n', 'semi-final round.

Dishonesty in a woman is \\n', 'a thing you never blame deeply�I was casually sorry, and \\n', 'then I forgot. It was on that same house party that we had a \\n', 'curious conversation about driving a car.
