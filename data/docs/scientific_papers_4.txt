studies of laser beams propagating through turbulent atmospheres are important for many applications such as remote sensing , tracking , and long - distance optical communications .
howerver , fully coherent laser beams are very sensitive to fluctuations of the atmospheric refractive index .
the initially coherent laser beam acquires some properties of gaussian statistics in course of its propagation through the turbulence . as a result , the noise / signal ratio approaches unity for long - distance propagation .
( see , for example , refs.@xcite-@xcite ) .
this unfavourable effect limits the performance of communication channels . to mitigate this negative effect
the use of partially ( spatially ) coherent beams was proposed .
the coherent laser beam can be transformed into a partially coherent beam by means of a phase diffuser placed near the exit aperture .
this diffuser introduces an additional phase ( randomly varying in space and time ) to the wave front of the outgoing radiation .
statistical characteristics of the random phase determine the initial transverse coherence length of the beam .
it is shown in refs .
@xcite,@xcite that a considerable decrease in the noise / signal ratio can occur under following conditions : ( i ) the ratio of the initial transverse coherence length , @xmath0 , to the beam radius , @xmath1 , should be essentially smaller than unity ; and ( ii ) the characteristic time of phase variations , @xmath2 , should be much smaller than the integration time , @xmath3 , of the detector .
however , only limiting cases @xmath4 and @xmath5 have been considered in the literature .
( see , for example , refs .
@xcite,@xcite and ref .
@xcite , respectively ) .
it is evident that the inequality @xmath6 can be easily satisfied by choosing a detector with very long integration time . at the same time
, this kind of the detector can not distinguish different signals within the interval @xmath3 .
this means that the resolution of the receiving system might become too low for the case of large @xmath3 . on the other hand
, there is a technical restriction on phase diffusers : up to now their characteristic times , @xmath2 , are not smaller than @xmath7 . besides that , in some specific cases ( see , for example , ref .
@xcite ) , the spectral broadening of laser radiation due to the phase diffuser ( @xmath8 ) may become unacceptably high .
the factors mentioned above impose serious restrictions on the physical characteristics of phase diffusers which could be potentially useful for suppressing the intensity fluctuations .
an adequate choice of diffusers may be facilitated if we know in detail the effect of finite - time phase variation , introduced by them , on the photon statistics . in this case
, it is possible to control the performance of communication systems . in what follows , we will obtain theoretically the dependence of scintillation index on @xmath9 without any restrictions on the value of this ratio
this is the main purpose of our paper .
further analysis is based on the formalism developed in ref .
@xcite and modified here to understand the case of finite - time dynamics of the phase diffuser .
the detectors of the absorbed type do not sense the instantaneous intensity of electromagnetic waves @xmath10 .
they sense the intensity averaged over some finite interval @xmath3 i.e. @xmath11 usually , the averaging time @xmath3 ( the integration time of the detector ) is much smaller than the characteristic time of the turbulence variation , @xmath12 , ( @xmath13 ) .
therefore , the average value of the intensity can be obtained by further averaging of eq .
[ one ] over many measurements corresponding various realizations of the refractive - index configurations .
the scintillation index determining the mean - square fluctuations of the intensity is defined by @xmath14\bigg /\big
< \bar{i}\big > ^2=
\frac{\big < : \bar i(t ) ^2:\big>}{\big<\bar i \big>^2}-1,\ ] ] where the symbol @xmath15 indicates the normal ordering of the creation and annihilation operators which determine the intensity , @xmath10 .
( see more details in refs .
@xcite,@xcite ) . the brackets @xmath16 indicate quantum - mechanical and atmospheric averagings .
the intensity @xmath17 depends not only on @xmath18 , but also on the spatial variable @xmath19 . therefore , the detected intensity is the intensity @xmath20 averaged not only over @xmath18 as in eq .
[ one ] , but also over the detector aperture . for simplicity , we will restrict ourselves to calculations of the intensity correlations for coinciding spatial points that correspond to `` small '' detector aperture .
this simplification is quite reasonable for a long - distance propagation path of the beam .    in the case of quasimonochromatic light
, we can choose @xmath20 in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the creation and annihilation operators of photons with momentum @xmath24 .
they are given in the heisenberg representation .
@xmath25 is the volume of the system .
it follows from eqs .
[ two],[three ] that @xmath26 can be obtained if one knows the average @xmath27 it is a complex problem to obtain this value for arbitrary turbulence strengths and propagation distances .
nevertheless , the following qualitative reasoning can help to do this in the case of strong turbulence .
we have mentioned that the laser light acquires the properties of gaussian statistics in the course of its propagation through the turbulent atmosphere . as a result , in the limit of infinitely long propagation path , @xmath28 , only 
diagonal " terms , i.e. terms with ( i ) @xmath29 or ( ii ) @xmath30 , @xmath31 contribute to the right part of eq . [ four ] . for large but still finite @xmath28
, there exist small ranges of @xmath32 in case ( i ) and @xmath33 , @xmath34 in case ( ii ) contributing into the sum in eq .
the presence of the mentioned regions is due to the two possible ways of correlating of four different waves ( see ref .
@xcite ) which enter the right hand side of eq .
[ four ] . as explained in ref .
@xcite , the characteristic sizes of regions ( i ) and ( ii ) depend on the atmospheric broadening of beam radii as @xmath35 , thus decreasing with increasing @xmath28 . in the case of long - distance propagation , @xmath36 is much smaller than the component of photon wave - vectors perpendicular to the @xmath28 axis .
the last quantity grows with @xmath28 as @xmath37 .
( see ref .
@xcite ) . for this reason ,
the overlapping of regions ( i ) and ( ii ) can be neglected . in this case
eq . [ four ] can be rewritten in the convenient form : @xmath38 @xmath39 where the value @xmath40 , confining summation over @xmath41 , is chosen to be greater than @xmath42 but much smaller than the characteristic transverse wave vector of the photons ; this is consistent with the above explanations .
the two terms in the right - hand side correspond to the two regions of four - wave correlations .
the quantity @xmath43 entering the right side of eq . [ five ] is the operator of photon density in phase space ( the photon distribution function in @xmath44 space ) .
it was used in refs . @xcite,@xcite and
@xcite for the description of photon propagation in turbulent atmospheres . by analogy
, we can define the two - time distribution function @xmath45 then eq . [ five ] can be rewritten in terms of the distribution functions as @xmath46    let us represent @xmath47 in the form @xmath48 .
we assume that @xmath49 , as explained in the text after eq.[one ] . in this case
the hamiltonian of photons in a turbulent atmosphere can be considered to be independent of time . as a result , both functions defined by eqs .
[ six ] and [ seven ] satisfy the same kinetic equation , i.e.    @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the photon velocity , @xmath53 is a random force , caused by the turbulence .
this force is equal to @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the frequency of laser radiation .
@xmath56 is the refractive index of the atmosphere .
the general solution of the equation for @xmath48 can be written in the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 @xmath59 the functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 obey the equations of motion @xmath62 with the boundary conditions @xmath63 .
the instant @xmath64 is equal to @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the speed of light .
@xmath64 is the time of the exit of photons from the source .
this choice of @xmath64 makes it possible to neglect the influence of the turbulence on the initial values of operators @xmath67 ( their dependence on time is as in vacuum ) .
the term for @xmath68 can be obtained from eq . [ twelve ] by putting @xmath69 . substituting both distribution functions into eq .
[ eight ] , we obtain @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72:\big>,\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are solutions of eqs .
[ twelve ] with the initial conditions @xmath63 and @xmath75 , respectively .
the operators on the right side of eq . [ thirteen ] are related through matching conditions with the amplitudes of the exiting laser radiation ( see ref .
@xcite ) by the relation @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the operator of the laser field which is assumed to be a single - mode field and the subscript ( @xmath78 ) means perpendicular to the @xmath28-axis component .
the function @xmath79 describes the profile of the laser mode , which is assumed to be gaussian - type function [ @xmath80 .
@xmath1 desribes the initial radius of the beam .    to account for the effect of the phase diffuser
, a factor @xmath81 or @xmath82 should be inserted into the integrand of eq . [ fourteen ] .
the quantity @xmath83 is the random phase introduced by the phase diffuser .
a similar consideration is applicable to each of four photon operators entering both terms in square brackets of eq .
[ thirteen ] .
it can be easily seen that the factor @xmath84},\ ] ] describing the effect of phase screen on the beam , enters implicitly the integrand of eq .
[ thirteen ] ( the indices @xmath78 are omitted here for the sake of brevity ) .
there are integrations over variables @xmath85 as shown in eq .
[ fourteen ] .
furthermore , the brackets @xmath16 , which indicate averaging over different realizations of the atmosperic inhomogeneities , also indicate averaging over different states of the phase diffuser .
as long as both types of averaging do not correlate , the factor ( [ fifteen ] ) entering eq .
[ thirteen ] must be averaged over different instants , @xmath64 . to begin with ,
let us consider the simplest case of two phase correlations @xmath86}\big > .\ ] ] it is evident that in the case @xmath87 , as shown schematically in fig .
1 , the factor ( [ sixteen ] ) is sizable if only points @xmath19 and @xmath88 are close to one another .
two curves correspond to different instants @xmath18 and @xmath89 . ]    therefore , the term given by eq .
[ sixteen ] can be replaced by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is considered to be a gaussian random variable with the mean - square values given by @xmath92 ^ 2\rangle =   \langle [ \frac { \partial \varphi ( { \bf r},t_0)}{\partial y}]^2\rangle = 2\lambda _ c^{-2}$ ] , where @xmath93 is the correlation length of phase fluctuations . ( see fig.1 ) . as we see , in this case the effect of phase fluctuations can be described by the schell model @xcite-@xcite,@xcite-@xcite .    a somewhat more complex situation is for the average value of @xmath94 given by eq . [ fifteen ] .
there is an effective phase correlation not only in the case of coincident times , but also for differing times . for @xmath95 , two different sets of coordinates contribute considerably to phase correlations .
this can be described mathematically as @xmath96}\big > \approx \big < e^{i[\varphi ( { \bf r},t_0)-\varphi   ( { \bf r^\prime},t_0)]}\big > \times\ ] ] @xmath97}\big > + \big < e^{i[\varphi ( { \bf r},t_0)-\varphi   ( { \bf r^\prime _
1},t_0+\tau ) ] } \big > \big < e^{i[\varphi ( { \bf r_1},t_0+\tau ) -\varphi   ( { \bf r^\prime } , t_0)]}\big > .\ ] ] repeating the arguments leading to eq .
[ seventeen ] , we represent the difference in the last term @xmath98 as @xmath99 then , considering the random functions @xmath100 and @xmath101 as independent gaussian variables , we obtain a simple expression for @xmath102 . it is given by @xmath103}+ e^{-\lambda _ c^{-2}[({\bf r - r^\prime}_1)^2+({\bf r^\prime -r_1})^2]-2\nu^2\tau ^2},\ ] ] where @xmath104 ^ 2\rangle = 2\nu^2 $ ] .    as we see , the effect of the phase screen can be described by two parameters , @xmath93 and @xmath105 , which characterize the spatial and temporal coherence of the laser beam . in the limiting case , @xmath106 , the second term in eq .
[ twenty ] vanishes and the problem is reduced to the case considered in refs .
@xcite,@xcite . in the opposite case , @xmath107 , both terms in eq .
[ twenty ] are important .
this is shown in ref .
@xcite . in
what follows , we will see that these two limiting cases have physical interpretations where where @xmath108 ( slow detector ) and @xmath109 ( fast detector ) , respectively .
there is a specific realization of the diffuser in which a random phase distribution moves across the beam .
( this situation can be modeled by a rotating transparent disk with large diameter and varying thickness . )
the phase depends here on the only variable @xmath110 , i.e. @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the velocity of the drift .
then we have @xmath113}+e^{-\lambda _ c^{-2}[({\bf r - r^\prime_1+v}\tau)^2+({\bf r^\prime -r_1+v}\tau)^2]}.\ ] ] comparing eqs .
[ twenty ] and [ twtw ] , we see that the quantity , @xmath114 , stands for the characteristic parameter describing the efficiency of the phase diffuser .
the criterion of  slow " detector requires @xmath115 .
qualitatively , the two scenarios of phase variations , given by eqs . [ twenty ] and [ twtw ] , affect in a similar way the intensity fluctuations . in what follows
, we consider the first of them as the simplest one .
( this is because the spatial and temporal variables in @xmath102 , given by eq . [
twenty ] , are separable . )
_ vs _ propagation distance @xmath28 in the case of `` slow '' detector : @xmath116 .
the parameter @xmath117 indicates different initial coherence length . in the absence of phase diffuser @xmath118 ( solid line ) .
@xmath119 is the conventional parameter describing a strength of the atmospheric turbulence . ]
substituting the expressions for operators given by eq .
[ fourteen ] with account for the phase factors @xmath120 and averaging over time as shown in eq .
[ one ] , we obtain @xmath121 @xmath122\bigg > , \ ] ] where the notation @xmath16 after sums indicates averaging over different realizations of the atmospheric refractive index .
the parameter @xmath123 describes the initial coherence length modified by the phase diffuser .
other notations are defined by following relations @xmath124
@xmath125 @xmath126 further calculations follow the scheme described in ref @xcite .
2 illustrates the effect of the phase diffuser on scintillations in the limit of a  slow " detector ( @xmath127 ) .
we can see a considerable decrease in @xmath128 caused by the phase diffuser . at the same time , the effect of the phase screen on @xmath128 becomes weaker for finite values of @xmath129 .
moreover , comparing the two upper curves in fig .
3 , we see the opposite effect : slow phase variations ( @xmath130 ) result in increased scintillations .
there is a simple explanation for this phenomenon : the noise generated by the turbulence is complemented by the noise arising from the random phase screen .
the integration time of the detector , @xmath3 , is not sufficiently large for averaging phase variations generated by the diffuser .
the function , @xmath131 , has a very simple form in the two limits : ( i)@xmath132 , when @xmath133 ; and ( ii ) @xmath134 , when @xmath109 .
then , in case ( i ) and for small values of the initial coherence [ @xmath135 , the asymptotic term for the scintillation index ( @xmath136 ) is given by @xmath137 the right - hand side of eq .
[ twfo ] differs from analogous one in ref .
@xcite by the value @xmath138 that is much less than unity but , nevertheless , can be comparable or even greater than @xmath139 .    in case ( ii )
, the asymptotic value of @xmath26 is close to unity , coinciding with the results of refs . @xcite and @xcite .
this agrees with well known behavior of the scintillation index to approach unity for any source distribution , provided the response time of the recording instrument is short compared with the source coherence time .
( see , for example , survey @xcite ) .
a similar tendency can be seen in both figs . 3 and 4 : the curves with the smallest @xmath129 , used for numerical calculations ( @xmath130 ) , are close to the curves  without diffuser " in spite of the small initial coherence length [ @xmath140 .
it can also be seen that all curves approach their asymptotic values very slowly .
describing diffuser dynamics .
the solid curve is calculated for @xmath118 ( without diffuser ) .
other curves are for @xmath141 . ]    . ]
it follows from our analysis that the scintillation index is very sensitive to the diffuser parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath142 , for long propagation paths .
on the other hand , the characteristics of the irradience such as beam radius , @xmath143 , and angle - of - arrival spread , @xmath144 , do not depend on the presence of the phase diffuser for large values of @xmath28 . to see this , the following analysis is useful .
the beam radius expressed in terms of the distribution function is given by @xmath145 straightforward calculations using eq .
[ ten ] with @xmath69 ( see ref .
@xcite ) result in the following explicit form : @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 is the inner radius of turbulent eddies , which in our previous calculations was assumed to be equal @xmath149 m . as we see , the third term does not depend on the diffuser parameters and it dominates when @xmath150 .
a similar situation holds for the angle - of - arrival spread , @xmath144 .
( this physical quantity is of great importance for the performance of communication systems based on frequency encoded information @xcite . )
it is defined by the distribution function as @xmath151 simple calculations , which are very similar to those while obtaining @xmath152 , result in @xmath153 ^ 2=\frac 2{r_1 ^ 2q_0 ^ 2}+12tz-\frac { 4z^2}{q_0 ^ 4r^2}(r_1^{-2}+3tq_0 ^ 2z)^2.\ ] ] for long propagation paths ,
. [ twei ] reduces to @xmath154 , which like @xmath152 does not depend on the diffuser parameters .
as we see , for large distances @xmath28 , the quantities @xmath152 and @xmath144 do not depend on @xmath93 and @xmath105 .
this contrasts with the case of the scintillation index .
so pronounced differences can be explained by differences in the physical nature of these characteristics .
it follows from eq .
[ two ] that the functional , @xmath26 , is quadratic in the distribution function , @xmath155 .
hence , four - wave correlations determine the value of scintillation index .
the main effect of a phase diffuser on @xmath26 is to destroy correlations between waves exited at different times .
( see more explanations in ref .
this is achieved at sufficiently small parameters @xmath93 and @xmath156 .
in contrast , @xmath152 and @xmath144 depend on two wave - correlations , both waves being given at the same instant .
therefore , the values of @xmath152 and @xmath144 do not depend on the rate of phase variations [ @xmath105 does not enter the factor ( [ seventeen ] ) describing the effect of phase diffuser ] .
moreover , these quantities become independent of @xmath93 at long propagation paths because light scattering on atmospheric inhomogeneities prevails in this case .
the plots in figs .
3 anf 4 show that the finite - time effect is quite sizable even for very  slow " detectors ( @xmath157 ) .
our paper makes it possible to estimate the actual utility of phase diffusers in several physical regimes .
we have analyzed the effects of a diffuser on scintillations for the case of large - amplitude phase fluctuations .
this specific case is very convenient for theoretial analysis because only two parameters are required to describe the effects of the diffuser .
phase fluctuations may occur independently in space as well as in time .
also , our formalism can be applied for the physical situation in which a spatially random phase distribution drifts across the beam .
[ twtw ] . )
our results show the importance of both parameters , @xmath93 and @xmath142 , on the ability of a phase diffuser to suppress scintillations .
