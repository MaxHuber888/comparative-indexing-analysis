one surprising result that has come out of the more than 200 extrasolar planet discoveries to date is the wide range of eccentricities observed . unlike our own solar system
, many of the extrasolar planets which are not tidally locked to their host stars have moderate eccentricities ( @xmath1 ) , and 15 planets have high eccentricities ( @xmath0 ) .
these observations have spawned several theories as to the origin of highly eccentric extrasolar planets .
one such method , planet - planet scattering , occurs when multiple jovian planets form several astronomical units ( au ) from the host star and then interact , leaving one in an eccentric orbit and often ejecting the other @xcite .
this method has been proposed to explain the architecture of the @xmath2 and planetary system @xcite , which contains a hot jupiter as well as two jovian planets in moderately eccentric orbits .
@xcite suggested a merger scenario in which inner protoplanets perturb each other and merge to form a single massive , eccentric planet with @xmath3 and @xmath4 au .
interactions with stellar companions are another possible way to boost a planet s eccentricity .
of the 15 stars hosting a planet with @xmath0 , six are also known to possess stellar - mass companions in wide binary orbits : hd  3651 @xcite , hd  20782 @xcite , hd  80606 , hd  89744 @xcite , 16  cyg  b , and hd  222582 @xcite .
if the inclination angle between the planetary orbit and a stellar companion is large , the kozai mechanism @xcite can induce large - amplitude oscillations in the eccentricity of the planet ( e.g.  malmberg et al .
these oscillations can be damped by general relativistic effects and by interaction with other planets , and hence are most effective in systems with a single planet in an orbit @xmath51  au from the host star @xcite .
the kozai mechanism has been suggested to explain the high eccentricity of 16  cyg  bb @xcite and hd  80606b @xcite .
@xcite found the inclination of 16  cyg  b orbiting the system barycenter to lie between 100 and 160 degrees , where 90 degrees is an edge - on orientation .
however , it is the difference in inclination between the orbital planes of the planetary and stellar companion that is critical in determining the importance of the kozai mechanism , and the inclination of the planet s orbit is generally not known for non - transiting systems .    of the 192 known planetary systems , 23 ( 12% )
are multi - planet systems .
recent discoveries of additional objects in systems known to host at least one planet @xcite suggest that multiple - planet systems are common .
of particular interest are systems which host a jovian planet and a low - mass `` hot neptune , '' e.g.  55  cnc ( = hd  75732 ) , gj  876 , @xmath6 arae ( = hd  160691 ) , gl  777a ( = hd  190360 ) . motivated by the discoveries of hot neptunes in known planetary systems , we have undertaken an intensive survey of selected single - planet systems to search for additional low - mass companions .
three of the planetary systems discussed in this paper ( hd  3651 , hd  80606 , hd  89744 ) are part of this campaign .
the excellent radial - velocity precision of the high resolution spectrograph on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) , combined with queue - scheduling , allow us to time the observations in such a way as to minimize phase gaps in the orbit of the known planet , and also to act quickly on potential new planet candidates .
the use of the het in this manner is discussed further in @xcite with regard to the discovery of hd  37605b .    in this work
, we aim to combine observational limits on additional planets in known planetary systems with dynamical constraints obtained by n - body simulations .
the observations address the question : what additional planets are ( or are not ) in these systems ?
the dynamical simulations can answer the question : where are additional planets possible ?
section  2 describes the observations and the test particle simulations for six highly eccentric planetary systems : hd  3651 , hd  37605 , hd  45350 , hd  80606 , hd  89744 , and 16
cyg  b. we have chosen these systems based on two criteria : ( 1 ) each hosts a planet with @xmath0 , and ( 2 ) each has been observed by the planet search programs at mcdonald observatory . in  3 , we present and discuss the results of the updated orbital fits , dynamical simulations , and detection limit computations .
five of the six stars considered in this work have been observed with the mcdonald observatory 9.2  m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) using its high resolution spectrograph ( hrs ) @xcite .
a full description of the het planet search program is given in @xcite .
for 16  cyg  b , observations from mcdonald observatory were obtained only with the 2.7  m harlan j.  smith ( hjs ) telescope ; the long - term planet search program on this telescope is described in @xcite .
all available published data on these systems were combined with our data from mcdonald observatory in the orbit fitting procedures .      to place constraints on the architecture of planetary systems , we would like to know where additional objects can remain in stable orbits in the presence of the known planet(s ) .
we performed test particle simulations using swifthal / swift.html . ]
@xcite to investigate the dynamical possibility of additional low - mass planets in each of the six systems considered here .
low - mass planets can be treated as test particles since the exchange of angular momentum with jovian planets is small .
we chose the regularized mixed - variable symplectic integrator ( rmvs3 ) version of swift for its ability to handle close approaches between massless , non - interacting test particles and planets .
particles are removed if they are ( 1 ) closer than 1 hill radius to the planet , ( 2 ) closer than 0.05  au to the star , or ( 3 ) farther than 10  au from the star .
since the purpose of these simulations is to determine the regions in which additional planets could remain in stable orbits , we set this outer boundary because the current repository of radial - velocity data can not detect objects at such distances .
the test particle simulations were set up following the methods used in @xcite , with the exception that only initially circular orbits are considered in this work . for each planetary system ,
test particles were placed in initially circular orbits spaced every 0.002  au in the region between 0.05 - 2.0  au .
we have chosen to focus on this region because the duration of our high - precision het data is currently only 2 - 4 years for the objects in this study .
the test particles were coplanar with the existing planet , which had the effect of confining the simulation to two dimensions .
input physical parameters for the known planet in each system were obtained from our keplerian orbit fits described in   3.1 , and from recent literature for 16  cyg  b @xcite and hd  45350 @xcite .
the planetary masses were taken to be their minimum values ( sin  @xmath7 ) .
the systems were integrated for @xmath8 yr , following @xcite and allowing completion of the computations in a reasonable time .
we observed that nearly all of the test - particle removals occurred within the first @xmath9 yr ; after this time , the simulations had essentially stabilized to their final configurations .
we present updated keplerian orbital solutions for hd  3651b , hd  37605b , hd  80606b , and hd  89744b in table  1 .
a summary of the data used in our analysis is given in table  2 , and the het radial velocities are given in tables  3 - 6 .
the velocity uncertainties given for the het data represent internal errors only , and do not include any external sources of error such as stellar `` jitter . ''
the parameters for the remaining two planets , hd  45350b and 16  cyg  bb , are taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .
radial velocity measurements from the het are given for hd  45350 in @xcite , and velocities for 16  cyg  b from the hjs telescope are given in @xcite .
as in @xcite , all available published data were combined with those from mcdonald , and the known planet in each system was fit with a keplerian orbit using gaussfit @xcite , allowing the velocity offset between each data set to be a free parameter .
examination of the residuals to our keplerian orbit fits revealed no evidence for additional objects in any of the six systems in this study .
the saturn - mass ( m  sin  @xmath10 ) planet hd  3651b was discovered by @xcite using observations from lick and keck .
we fit these data , which were updated in @xcite , in combination with observations from the hjs and het at mcdonald observatory .
the het data , which consist of multiple exposures per visit , were binned using the inverse - variance weighted mean value of the velocities in each visit .
the standard error of the mean was added in quadrature to the weighted rms about the mean velocity to generate the error bar of each binned point ( n=29 ) .
the rms about the combined fit for each dataset is : lick & keck6.6 , het9.4 , hjs12.2 .
the fitted orbital parameters for hd  3651b are of comparable precision to those reported in @xcite , and agree within 2@xmath11 .
the recent discovery of a t dwarf companion to hd  3651 @xcite prompts an interesting exercise : can the radial - velocity trend due to this object be detected in the residuals after removing the planet ?
we detect a slope of @xmath12  yr@xmath13 , indicating that we are indeed able to discern a trend which is possibly due to the binary companion .
however , the reduced @xmath14 of the orbital solution is not significantly improved by the inclusion of a linear trend ( @xmath15=0.18 ) .
the parameters given in table  1 were obtained from the fit which did not include a trend .
we present 23 new het observations for hd  37605 obtained since its announcement by @xcite .
the data now span a total of 1065  days .
the best fit is obtained by including an acceleration of @xmath16  yr@xmath13 , indicating a distant orbiting body .
such a finding would lend support to the hypothesis that very eccentric single - planet systems originate by interactions within a wide binary system .
the shortest period that this outer companion could have and still remain consistent with the observed acceleration and its uncertainty over the timespan of the observations is about 40  yr , assuming a circular orbit .
this object would then have a minimum mass in the brown dwarf range
.    the planet orbiting hd  80606 , first announced by @xcite , is the most eccentric extrasolar planet known , with @xmath17 ( table  1 ) .
we have fit the coralie data in combination with the keck data given in @xcite and 23 observations from het .
the extreme velocity variations induced by this planet greatly increase the sensitivity of orbit fits to the weighting of individual measurements . since the uncertainties of the het velocities given in tables  3 - 6 represent internal errors only , we experimented with adding 1 - 7 of radial - velocity `` jitter '' in quadrature before fitting the data for hd  80606 .
for all of these jitter values , the fitted parameters remained the same within their uncertainties .
table  1 gives the parameters derived from a fit which added 3.5  of jitter @xcite to the het data .
the rms about the combined fit is : coralie18.7 , het7.5 , keck5.6 .
@xcite noted that the eccentricity @xmath18 and the argument of periastron @xmath19 had to be held fixed in their fit to the keck data alone .
however , the large number of measurements included in this work allowed gaussfit to converge with all parameters free .    for hd  89744b , we combine data from the het with 6 measurements from the hjs telescope and lick data from @xcite .
the het data were binned in the same manner as for hd  3651 , resulting in n=33 independent visits .
the rms about the combined fit for each dataset is : lick17.1 , het10.7 , hjs9.5 . as with hd  3651b ,
our derived parameters agree with those of @xcite within 2@xmath11 .
the scatter about our fit remains large , most likely due to the star s early spectral type ( f7v ) , which hinders precision radial - velocity measurements due to the smaller number of spectral lines .
for example , the f7v star hd  221287 was recently found to host a planet @xcite ; despite the superb instrumental precision of the harps spectrograph , that orbital solution has a residual rms of 8.5 .
the results of the dynamical simulations are shown in figures  1 - 3 .
the survival time of the test particles is plotted against their initial semimajor axis .
as shown in figure  1 , the short - period planets hd  3651 and hd  37605 sweep clean the region inside of about 0.5  au . in both of these systems , however , a small number of test particles remained in low - eccentricity orbits near the known planet s apastron distance , near the 1:2 mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) . in the hd  3651 system , particles remained stable beyond about 0.6  au , which is not surprising given the low mass of the planet . for hd  37605 ,
two distinct strips of stability are seen in fig .  1 , corresponding to the 1:2 and 1:3 mmrs .
the eccentricity of the test particles in the region of the 1:2 mmr oscillated between 0.00 and 0.06 .
particles in 1:3 mmr oscillated in eccentricity with a larger range , up to @xmath20 , which is expected due to secular forcing . as with hd  3651 , the region beyond about 0.8  au
was essentially unaffected by the planet .
figure  2 shows the results for the hd  45350 and hd  80606 systems .
the long period ( 963.6 days ) and relatively large mass ( m  sin  @xmath21=1.8 ) of hd  45350b restricted stable orbits to the innermost 0.2  au .
these test particles oscillated in eccentricity up to @xmath22 .
the 4  planet orbiting hd  80606 removed all test particles to a distance of about 1.5  au , and only beyond 1.75  au did test particles remain in stable orbits for the duration of the simulation ( @xmath8 yr ) .
a region of instability is evident at 1.9  au due to the 8:1 mmr .
figure  3 shows that hd  89744b eliminated all test particles except for a narrow region near the 8:3 resonance .
for the 16  cyg  b system , only particles inside of about 0.3  au remained stable , leaving open the possibility of short - period planets .
the surviving particles oscillated in eccentricity up to @xmath23 , but these simulations treat the star as a point mass , and hence tidal damping of the eccentricity is not included
. our results are consistent with those of @xcite , who investigated dynamical stability in extrasolar planetary systems and found that no test particles survived in the habitable zones of the hd  80606 , hd  89744 , and 16  cyg  b systems .
three of these systems ( hd  3651 , hd  80606 , hd  89744 ) were monitored intensely with the het as part of a larger effort to search for low - mass , short period planets .
no evidence was found for any such objects in these or any of the six systems in this work .
we then asked what limits can be set on additional planets using the high - precision het data we have obtained .
the procedure for determining companion limits was identical to the method described in @xcite , except that in this work , the best - fit keplerian orbit for the known planet ( see   3.1 ) was removed before performing the limits computations . in this way
, we determined the radial - velocity amplitude @xmath24 for which 99% of planets would have been detected in the residuals .
the eccentricity of the injected test signals was chosen to be the mean eccentricity of the surviving particles from the simulations described in   3.2 . only the regions in which test particles survived were considered in these limits computations .
the results of these computations were highly varied , reflecting the differing observing strategies employed for these six objects .
in particular , hd  3651 , hd  80606 , and hd  89744 were monitored intensely with the het as part of a search for short - period objects , whereas hd  37605 and hd  45350 were only observed sporadically after the known planet orbits were defined and published @xcite , and 16  cyg  b has only been observed with the hjs telescope at a frequency of at most once per month .
the companion limits are shown in figures  4 - 6 ; planets with masses above the solid line can be ruled out by the data with 99% confidence .
not surprisingly , the tightest limits were obtained for hd  3651 ( figure  4 ) , which had a total of 195 measurements , including 29 independent het visits .
for periods less than about 1  year , we can exclude planets with m  sin  @xmath21  2 neptune masses .
similar results were obtained for 16  cyg  b ( n=161 ) , where the limits approach a neptune mass ( figure  6 ) .
since the detection limits generally improve with the addition of more data and with higher - quality data , we can define a quantity to measure the goodness of the limits .
a simple choice would be @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the total number of observations , and @xmath27 is the mean uncertainty of the radial - velocity measurements .
the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are given in table  2 .    in the hd  45350 system , the results of the dynamical simulations complement those of the detection limit determinations .
very tight limits are obtained in close orbits ( @xmath280.2  au ) . in this region ,
test particles were stable ( fig .  2 ) and our observations can exclude planets with m  sin  _ i _ between about 1 and 4 neptune masses .
similar results were obtained for the 16  cyg  b system , in which test particles remained stable inward of @xmath29  0.3  au . in that region ,
planets of 1 - 3 neptune masses can be excluded by our limits determinations ( fig .
6 ) . in most of the limits determinations
, there are multiple `` blind spots '' evident where the periodogram method failed to significantly recover the injected signals .
typically this occurs at certain trial periods for which the phase coverage of the observational data is poor , and often at the 1-month and 1-year windows .    for none of hd  37605 ( fig .  4 ) , hd  80606 ( fig .  5 ) , or hd  89744 ( fig .
6 ) could additional companions be ruled out below about 0.7 , and for most orbital periods tested , the limits were substantially worse .
one possible explanation for this result is that the sampling of the observations was poorly distributed in phase for many of the injected test signals , making significant recovery by the periodogram method difficult .
this is evidenced by the `` jagged '' regions in the plots .
also , the intrinsic scatter for those three systems was too large to permit tight limits determination .
this is certainly reasonable for the f7 star hd  89744 .
the three systems with the best limits ( hd  3651 , hd  45350 , and 16  cyg  b ) also had the lowest rms scatter about their orbital solutions ( mean=@xmath30 ; table  1 ) .
in contrast , the mean rms for the remaining three systems was @xmath31 .
additional factors such as a paucity of data ( hd  37605 ) and short time baselines ( hd  80606 , hd  89744 ) made the determination of useful companion limits challenging for some of the planetary systems in this study .
we have shown that for a sample of six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems , there is no evidence for additional planets .
test particle simulations show that there are regions detectable by current surveys ( i.e.  for @xmath32 au ) where additional objects can exist . for hd  3651 and hd  37605
, we find that protected resonances are also present .
combining these simulations with detection limits computed using new high - precision het data combined with all available published data is particularly effective for the hd  3651 and hd  45350 systems .
additional short - period planets can be ruled out down to a few neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions in these systems .
