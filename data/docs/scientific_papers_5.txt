the so - called `` nucleon spin crisis '' raised by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) measurement in 1988 is one of the most outstanding findings in the field of hadron physics @xcite,@xcite .
the renaissance of the physics of high energy deep inelastic scatterings is greatly indebted to this epoch - making finding .
probably , one of the most outstanding progresses achieved recently in this field of physics is the discovery and the subsequent research of completely new observables called generalized parton distribution functions ( gpd ) .
it has been revealed that the gpds , which can be measured through the so - called deeply - virtual compton scatterings ( dvcs ) or the deeply - virtual meson productions ( dvmp ) , contain surprisingly richer information than the standard parton distribution functions @xcite@xcite .
roughly speaking , the gpds are generalization of ordinary parton distributions and the elastic form factors of the nucleon .
the gpds in the most general form are functions of three kinematical variables : the average longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath1 of the struck parton in the initial and final states , a skewdness parameter @xmath3 which measures the difference between two momentum fractions , and the four - momentum - transfer square @xmath4 of the initial and final nucleon . in the forward limit @xmath5 ,
some of the gpds reduce to the usual quark , antiquark and gluon distributions .
on the other hand , taking the @xmath0-th moment of the gpds with respect to the variable @xmath1 , one obtains the generalizations of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon , which are called the generalized form factors of the nucleon .
the complex nature of the gpds , i.e. the fact that they are functions of three variable , makes it quite difficult to grasp their full characteristics both experimentally and theoretically . from the theoretical viewpoint
, it may be practical to begin studies with the two limiting cases .
the one is the forward limit of zero momentum transfer .
we have mentioned that , in this limit , some of the gpds reduce to the ordinary parton distribution function depending on one variable @xmath1 .
however , it turns out that , even in this limit , there appear some completely new distribution functions , which can not be accessed by the ordinary inclusive deep - inelastic scattering measurements .
very interestingly , it was shown by ji that one of such distributions contains valuable information on the total angular momentum carried by the quark fields in the nucleon @xcite@xcite .
this information , combined with the known knowledge on the longitudinal quark polarization , makes it possible to determine the quark orbital angular momentum contribution to the total nucleon spin purely experimentally .
another relatively - easy - to - handle quantities are the generalized form factors of the nucleon @xcite,@xcite , which are given as the non - forward nucleon matrix elements of the spin-@xmath0 , twist - two quark and gluon operators .
since these latter quantities are given as the nucleon matrix elements of local operators , they can be objects of lattice qcd simulations .
( it should be compared with parton distributions .
the direct calculation of parton distributions is beyond the scope of lattice qcd simulations , since it needs to treat the nucleon matrix elements of quark bilinears , which are _ nonlocal in time_. ) in fact , two groups , the lhpc collaboration and the qcdsf collaboration independently investigated the generalized form factors of the nucleon , and gave several interesting predictions , which can in principle be tested by the measurement of gpds in the near future @xcite@xcite . although interesting , there is no _ a priori _ reason to believe that the predictions of these lattice simulations are realistic enough .
the reason is mainly that the above mentioned lattice simulation were carried out in the heavy pion regime around @xmath6 with neglect of the so - called disconnected diagrams .
our real world is rather close to the chiral limit with vanishing pion mass , and we know that , in this limit , the goldstone pion plays very important roles in some intrinsic properties of the nucleon .
the lattice simulation carried out in the heavy pion region is in danger of missing some important role of chiral dynamics .    on the other hand ,
the chiral quark soliton model ( cqsm ) is an effective model of baryons , which maximally incorporates the chiral symmetry of qcd and its spontaneous breakdown @xcite,@xcite .
( see @xcite@xcite for early reviews . )
it was already applied to the physics of ordinary parton distribution functions with remarkable success @xcite@xcite . for instance , an indispensable role of pion - like quark - antiquark correlation was shown to be essential to understand the famous nmc measurement , which revealed the dominance of the @xmath7-quark over the @xmath8-quark inside the proton @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .
then , it would be interesting to see what predictions the cqsm would give for the quantities mentioned above .
now , the main purpose of the present study is to study the generalized form factors of the nucleon within the framework of the cqsm and compare its predictions with those of the lattice qcd simulations . of our particular interest here
is to see the change of final theoretical predictions against the variation of the pion mass .
such an analysis is expected to give some hints for judging the reliability of the lattice qcd predictions at the present level for the observables in question .
the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect.ii
, we shall briefly explain how to introduce the nonzero pion mass into the scheme of the cqsm with pauli - villars regularization . in sect.iii
, we derive the theoretical expressions for the generalized form factors of the nucleon .
sect.iv is devoted to the discussion of the results of the numerical calculations .
some concluding remarks are then given in sect.v .
we start with the basic effective lagrangian of the chiral quark soliton model in the chiral limit given as @xmath9 with @xmath10 which describes the effective quark fields , with a dynamically generated mass @xmath11 , strongly interacting with pions @xcite,@xcite .
since one of the main purposes of the present study is to see how the relevant observables depend on pion mass , we add to @xmath12 an explicit chiral symmetry breaking term @xmath13 given by @xcite @xmath14 .
\label{eq : lsb}\ ] ] here the trace in ( [ eq : lsb ] ) is to be taken with respect to flavor indices .
the total model lagrangian is therefore given by @xmath15 naturally , one could have taken an alternative choice in which the explicit chiral - symmetry - breaking effect is introduced in the form of current quark mass term as @xmath16 .
we did not do so , because we do not know any consistent regularization of such effective lagrangian with finite current quark mass within the framework of the pauli - villars subtraction scheme , as explained in appendix of @xcite .
the effective action corresponding to the above lagrangian is given as @xmath17 = s_f [ u ] + s_m [ u ] , \label{eq : energsol}\ ] ] with @xmath18 = - \,i \,n_c \,\mbox{sp } \
,   \ln ( i \not\!\partial - m u^{\gamma_5 } ) , \ ] ] and @xmath19   = \int \frac{1}{4 } \,f_{\pi}^2 \,m_{\pi}^2 \ ,   \mbox{tr}_f \ , [ u ( x ) + u^{\dagger } ( x ) - 2 ] \,d^4 x .\ ] ] here @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 representing the trace of the dirac gamma matrices and the flavors ( isospins ) , respectively .
the fermion ( quark ) part of the above action contains ultra - violet divergences . to remove these divergences , we must introduce physical cutoffs . for the purpose of regularization , here we use the pauli - villars subtraction scheme . as explained in @xcite ,
we must eliminate not only the logarithmic divergence contained in @xmath23 $ ] but also the quadratic and logarithmic divergence contained in the equation of motion shown below .
to get rid of all these troublesome divergence , we need at least two subtraction terms .
the regularized action is thus defined as @xmath24 = s_f^{reg } [ u ] + s_m [ u ] , \ ] ] where @xmath25 = s_f [ u ] - \sum_{i = 1}^2 \,c_i \,s_f^{\lambda _ i } [ u ] .\ ] ] here @xmath26 is obtained from @xmath27 $ ] with @xmath11 replaced by the pauli - villars regulator mass @xmath28 .
these parameters are fixed as follows .
first , the quadratic and logarithmic divergence contained in the equation of motion ( or in the expression of the vacuum quark condensate ) can , respectively , removed if the subtraction constants satisfy the following two conditions : @xmath29 ( we recall that the condition which removes the logarithmic divergence in @xmath23 $ ] just coincides with the 1st of the above conditions . ) by solving the above equations for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we obtain @xmath32 which constrains the values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , once @xmath33 and @xmath34 are given . for determining @xmath33 and @xmath34
, we use two conditions @xmath35 and @xmath36 which amounts to reproducing the correct normalization of the pion kinetic term in the effective meson lagrangian and also the empirical value of the vacuum quark condensate . to derive soliton equation of motion , we must first write down a regularized expression for the static soliton energy . under the hedgehog ansatz @xmath37 for the background pion fields ,
it is obtained in the form : @xmath38 = e_f^{reg } [ f ( r ) ] + e_m [ f ( r ) ] , \ ] ] where the meson ( pion ) part is given by @xmath39 = - \,f_{\pi}^2 \,m_{\pi}^2 \int d^3 x \,[\cos f ( r ) - 1 ] , \ ] ] while the fermion ( quark ) part is given as @xmath40 = e_{val } + e_{v p}^{reg } , \label{eq : estatic}\ ] ] with @xmath41 here @xmath42 are the quark single - particle energies , given as the eigenvalues of the static dirac hamiltonian in the background pion fields : @xmath43 with @xmath44 , \label{eq : dirach}\ ] ] while @xmath45 denote energy eigenvalues of the vacuum hamiltonian given by ( [ eq : dirach ] ) with @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 ) . the particular state @xmath48 , which is a discrete bound - state orbital coming from the upper dirac continuum under the influence of the hedgehog mean field , is called the valence level .
the symbol @xmath49 in ( [ eq : regenerg ] ) denotes the summation over all the negative energy eigenstates of @xmath50 , i.e. the negative energy dirac continuum .
the soliton equation of motion is obtained from the stationary condition of @xmath51 $ ] with respect to the variation of the profile function @xmath52 : @xmath53 \nonumber \\   & = & 4 \pi r^2 \,\left\ { - \,m \,[s ( r ) \sin f ( r ) - p ( r ) \cos f ( r ) ]   + f_{\pi}^2 m_{\pi}^2 \sin f ( r ) \right\ } , \end{aligned}\ ] ] which gives @xmath54 here @xmath55 and @xmath56 are regularized scalar and pseudoscalar quark densities given as @xmath57 with @xmath58 while @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the corresponding densities evaluated with the regulator mass @xmath28 instead of the dynamical quark mass @xmath11 .
we also note that @xmath61 and @xmath62 . as usual
, a self - consistent soliton solution is obtained as follows with use of kahana and ripka s discretized momentum basis @xcite,@xcite .
first by assuming an appropriate ( though arbitrary ) soliton profile @xmath52 , the eigenvalue problem of the dirac hamiltonian is solved . using the resultant eigenfunctions and their associated eigenenergies
, one can calculate the regularized scalar and pseudoscalar densities @xmath55 and @xmath56 .
with use of these @xmath63 and @xmath64 , eq.([eq : profile ] ) can then be used to obtain a new soliton profile @xmath52 .
the whole procedure above is repeated with this new profile @xmath52 until the self - consistency is attained .
since the generalized form factors of the nucleon are given as moments of generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) , it is convenient to start with the theoretical expressions of the unpolarized gpds @xmath65 and @xmath66 within the cqsm . following the notation in @xcite,@xcite
, we introduce the quantities @xmath67 and @xmath68 here , the isoscalar and isovector combinations respectively correspond to the sum and the difference of the quark flavors @xmath69 and @xmath70 . the relation between these quantities and the generalized parton distribution functions @xmath71 and @xmath72
are obtained most conveniently in the so - called breit frame .
they are given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 these two independent combinations of @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be extracted through the spin projection of @xmath75 as @xmath76 where  tr " denotes the trace over spin indices , while @xmath77 .
now , within the cqsm , it is possible to evaluate the right - hand side ( rhs ) of ( [ eq : hetrace ] ) and ( [ eq : emtrace ] ) .
since the answers are already given in several previous papers @xcite@xcite , we do not repeat the derivation . here
we comment only on the following general structure of the theoretical expressions for relevant observables in the cqsm .
the leading contribution just corresponds to the mean field prediction , which is independent of the collective rotational velocity @xmath78 of the hedgehog soliton .
the next - to - leading order term takes account of the linear response of the internal quark motion to the rotational motion as an external perturbation , and consequently it is proportional to @xmath78 .
it is known that the leading - order term contributes to the isoscalar combination of @xmath79 and to the isovector combination of @xmath80 , while the isoscalar part of @xmath79 and the isovector part of @xmath80 survived only at the next - to - leading order of @xmath78 ( or of @xmath81 ) .
the leading - order gpds are then given as @xmath82 here the symbol @xmath83 denotes the summation over the occupied ( the valence plus negative - energy dirac sea ) quark orbitals in the hedgehog mean field . on the other hand ,
the theoretical expressions for the isovector part of @xmath84 and the isoscalar part of @xmath85 , which survive at the next - to - leading order , are a little more complicated .
they are given as double sums over the single quark orbitals as @xmath86 \
,   e^{i x m_n z^0 } \nonumber \\   & \ , & \hspace{30 mm } \times \ \langle n | \tau^a | m \rangle    \langle m | \,\tau^a \,(1 + \gamma^0 \gamma^3 ) \ ,   e^{-i ( z^0/2 ) \hat{p}_3 } \ ,   e^{i { \mbox{\boldmath$\delta$ } } \cdot { \mbox{\boldmath$x$ } } } \,e^{-i ( z^0/2 ) \hat{p}_3 }   | n \rangle .
\label{eq : gpdheiv}\end{aligned}\ ] ] and @xmath87   e^{i x m_n z^0 } \nonumber \\   & \ , & \hspace{25 mm } \times \ \langle n | \tau^b | m \rangle    \langle m | \,(1 + \gamma^0 \gamma^3 ) \,e^{-i ( z^0/2 ) \hat{p}_3 } \ ,   \frac{\varepsilon^{3 a b }
\delta^a}{{\mbox{\boldmath$\delta$}}_{\perp}^2 } \ ,   e^{i { \mbox{\boldmath$\delta$ } } \cdot { \mbox{\boldmath$x$ } } } \,e^{-i ( z^0/2 ) \hat{p}_3 }   | n \rangle   .
\label{eq : gpdemiv}\end{aligned}\ ] ] these four expressions for the unpolarized gpds , i.e. ( [ eq : gpdheis ] ) @xmath88 ( [ eq : gpdemiv ] ) , are the basic starting equations for our present study of the generalized form factors of the nucleon within the cqsm .
there are infinite tower of generalized form factors , which are defined as the @xmath0-th moments of gpds . in the present study ,
we confine ourselves to the 1st and the 2nd moments , which respectively corresponds to the standard electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon and the so - called gravitational form factors .
we are especially interested in the second one , since they are believed to contain valuable information on the spin contents of the nucleon through ji s angular momentum sum rule @xcite,@xcite . for each isospin channel , the 1st and the 2nd moments of @xmath89 define the sachs - electric and gravito - electric form factors as @xmath90 and @xmath91 on the other hand , the 1st and the 2nd moments of @xmath92 respectively define the sachs - magnetic and gravito - magnetic form factors as @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the following , we shall explain how we can calculate the generalized form factors based on the theoretical expressions of corresponding gpds , by taking @xmath95 and @xmath96 as examples .
setting @xmath97 and integrating over @xmath98 in ( [ eq : gpdheis ] ) , we obtain @xmath99 putting this expression into ( [ eq : ge10def ] ) , we have @xmath100 it is easy to see that , using the generalized spherical symmetry of the hedgehog configuration , the term containing the factor @xmath101 identically vanishes , so that @xmath102 is reduced to a simple form as follows : @xmath103 aside from the factor @xmath104 , this is nothing but the known expression for the isoscalar sachs - electric form factor of the nucleon in the cqsm @xcite .
a less trivial example is @xmath96 , which is defined as the 2nd moment of @xmath105 . inserting ( [ eq : heis ] ) into ( [ eq : ge10def ] ) and carrying out the integration over @xmath1 ,
we obtain @xmath106 using the partial - wave expansion of @xmath107 , this can be written as @xmath108 this can further be divided into four pieces as @xmath109 where @xmath110 with @xmath111 to proceed further , we first notice that , by using the generalized spherical symmetry , @xmath112 survives only when @xmath113 , i.e. @xmath114 which leads to the result : @xmath115 to evaluate @xmath116 , we first note that @xmath117^{(\lambda ) } .\ ] ] here , the generalized spherical symmetry dictates that @xmath118 must be zero , so that the rhs of the above equation is effectively reduced to @xmath119^{(0 ) } .\ ] ] this then gives @xmath120^{(0 ) } \ ,   \phi_n ( { \mbox{\boldmath$x$ } } ) .\end{aligned}\ ] ] owing to the identity @xmath121 we therefore find that @xmath122 next we investigate the third term @xmath123 . using @xmath124^{(\lambda ) }
\ \sim \ - \,\frac{1}{\sqrt{3 } } \,\delta_{l,1 } \,\delta_{m,0 } \ ,   [ y_1 ( \hat{x } ) \times \hat{{\mbox{\boldmath$p$ } } } ] ^{(0 ) } , \end{aligned}\ ] ] we obtain @xmath125^{(0 ) } \ ,   \phi_n ( { \mbox{\boldmath$x$ } } ) .\end{aligned}\ ] ] this term vanishes by the same reason as @xmath116 does .
the last term @xmath126 is a little more complicated .
we first notice that @xmath127^{(\lambda)}_0 \nonumber \\   & \sim & \sum_{\lambda } \ ,   \langle 1 0 1 0 | \lambda 0 \rangle \ ,   \langle l m \lambda 0 | 00 \rangle \ ,   [ y_l ( \hat{x } ) \times    [ { \mbox{\boldmath$\alpha$ } } \times \hat{{\mbox{\boldmath$p$ } } } ] ^{(\lambda ) } ] ^{(0 ) }    \nonumber \\   & = & \delta_{m , 0 } \,\langle 1 0 1 0 | l 0 \rangle \
,   \langle l 0 l 0 | 0 0 \rangle \ ,   [ y_l ( \hat{x } ) \times    [ { \mbox{\boldmath$   \alpha$ } } \times \hat{{\mbox{\boldmath$p$ } } } ] ^{(l ) } ] ^{(0 ) } , \end{aligned}\ ] ] which dictates that @xmath128 must be 0 or 2 . inserting the above expression into ( [ eq : m4 ] ) , and using the explicit values of clebsch - gordan coefficients
, @xmath126 becomes @xmath129^{(0 ) } \ ,   \phi_n ( { \mbox{\boldmath$x$ } } ) \nonumber \\   & + & \frac{\sqrt{4 \pi}}{\sqrt{6 } } \cdot \frac{n_c}{m_n }    \int d^3 x \,\sum_{n \leq 0 } \,\phi_n^{\dagger } ( { \mbox{\boldmath$x$ } } ) \
,   j_2 ( \delta_{\perp } x ) \ ,   [ y_2 ( \hat{x } ) \times    [ { \mbox{\boldmath$\alpha$ } } \times \hat{{\mbox{\boldmath$p$ } } } ] ^{(2 ) } ] ^{(0 ) } \ ,   \phi_n ( { \mbox{\boldmath$x$ } } ) .\end{aligned}\ ] ] using the identities @xmath130^{(0 ) }   & = & -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3 } } { \mbox{\boldmath$\alpha$ } } \cdot \hat{{\mbox{\boldmath$p$ } } } , \\   \ , [ y_2 ( \hat{x } )    \times [ { \mbox{\boldmath$\alpha$ } } \times { \mbox{\boldmath$p$ } } ] ^{(2 ) } ] ^{(0 ) }   & = & [ [ y_2 ( \hat{x } ) \times \hat{{\mbox{\boldmath$p$ } } } ] ^{(1 ) }    \times { \mbox{\boldmath$\alpha$ } } ] ^{(0 ) } , \end{aligned}\ ] ] @xmath126 can also be written as @xmath131^{(1 ) }   \times { \mbox{\boldmath$\alpha$ } } ] ^{(0 ) } \ ,   \phi_n ( { \mbox{\boldmath$x$ } } ) .\end{aligned}\ ] ] collecting the answers for @xmath132 and @xmath126 , we finally obtain @xmath133^{(1 ) }    \times { \mbox{\boldmath$\alpha$ } } ] ^{(0 ) } \,\phi_n ( { \mbox{\boldmath$x$ } } ) .\end{aligned}\ ] ]    up to now , we have obtained the theoretical expressions for the isoscalar combination of the generalized form factors @xmath95 and @xmath96 .
for notational convenience , we summarize these results in a little more compact forms as follows : @xmath134 and @xmath135^{(1 ) } \times { \mbox{\boldmath$\alpha$ } } ] ^{(0 ) } \ ,   | n \rangle \right\ } .
\label{eq : inthe20is}\end{aligned}\ ] ] as pointed out before , @xmath95 is @xmath104 times the isoscalar combination of standard sachs - electric form factor of the nucleon .
analogously , we may call @xmath96 the gravitoelectric form factor of the nucleon ( its quark part ) , since it is related to the nonforward nucleon matrix elements of the quark part of the qcd energy momentum tensor .
the other generalized form factors can be obtained in a similar way .
the isovector part of the generalized electric form factors survive only at the next - to - leading order of @xmath78 .
they are given as @xmath136 and @xmath137^{(1 ) } \times    { \mbox{\boldmath$\alpha$ } } ] ^{(0 ) } \,{\mbox{\boldmath$\tau$ } } \,|| n \rangle \right\ } .\end{aligned}\ ] ] the isoscalar combination of the generalized magnetic form factors also survive only at the next - to - leading order of @xmath78 , so that they are given as double sums over the single - quark orbitals in the hedgehog mean field as @xmath138 and @xmath139 we recall that @xmath140 just coincides with the known expression of the isoscalar sachs - magnetic form factor of the nucleon in the cqsm @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath141
is sometimes called the gravitomagnetic form factor of the nucleon ( its isoscalar part ) , which we can evaluate within the qcsm based on the above theoretical expression .
finally , the leading - order contribution to the isovector part of the generalized magnetic form factors are given as @xmath142 and @xmath143 especially interesting to us are the values of the generalized form factors in the forward limit @xmath5 .
the consideration of this limit is also useful for verifying consistency of our theoretical analyses , since it leads to fundamental sum rules discussed below .
we first consider the forward limit of @xmath95 . from ( [ eq : inthe10is ] ) , we find that @xmath144 subtracting the corresponding vacuum contribution , this reduces to @xmath145 .
if we remember the relation @xmath146 the forward limit of ( [ eq : inthe10is ] ) just leads to the sum rule : @xmath147 which denotes that the sum of the @xmath69-quark and @xmath70-quark numbers in the proton is three .
next we turn to the forward limit of @xmath96 , which gives @xmath148 it is easy to see that , after regularization and vacuum subtraction , the first term of the rhs of the above equation reduces to the fermion ( quark ) part of the soliton energy , i.e. @xmath149 in ( [ eq : estatic ] ) .
it was proved in @xcite that , in the cqsm with vanishing pion mass , the following identity holds : @xmath150 in the case of finite pion mass , which we are handling , this identity does not hold . instead
, we can prove ( see appendix ) that @xmath151 that is , the second term in the parenthesis of rhs of eq.([eq : momsum ] ) just coincides with the pion part of the soliton energy ( or mass ) . since the sum of the quark and pion part
give the total soliton mass @xmath152 , we then find that @xmath153 in consideration of eq.([eq : inthe20is ] ) , this relation can also be expressed as @xmath154 which means that the total momentum fraction carried by quark fields ( the @xmath69- and @xmath70-quarks ) is just unity .
this is an expected result , since the cqsm contains quark fields only ( note that the pion is not an independent field of quarks ) , so that the total nucleon momentum should be saturated by the quark fields alone .    taking the forward limit of @xmath155
, we are again led to a trivial sum rule , constrained by the conservation low .
in fact , we have @xmath156 thereby leading to @xmath157 which denotes that the difference of the @xmath69-quark and the @xmath70-quark numbers in the proton is just unity .
on the other hand , the forward limit of @xmath158 leads to the first nontrivial sum rule as @xmath159 since this quantity , which represents the difference of momentum fraction carried by the @xmath69-quark and the @xmath70-quark in the proton , is not constrained by any conservation law , its actual value can be estimated only numerically .
next we turn to the discussion of the forward limit of the generalized magnetic form factors .
first , the forward limit of @xmath140 gives @xmath160 which reproduces the known expression of the isoscalar magnetic moment of the nucleon in the cqsm @xcite . on the other hand ,
the forward limit of @xmath141 gives @xmath161 it was shown in @xcite that the rhs of the above equation is just unity , i.e. @xmath162 in consideration of ( [ eq : gm2nd ] ) , this identity can be recast into a little different form as @xmath163 \,d x .\end{aligned}\ ] ] assuming the familiar angular momentum sum rule due to ji @xmath164 \,d x   = j^{u + d } , \ ] ] the above identity claims that @xmath165 which means that the nucleon spin is saturated by the quark fields alone .
this is again a reasonable result , because the cqsm is an effective quark model which contains no explicit gluon fields .
the derived identity ( [ eq : gm20ist0 ] ) has still another interpretation .
remembering the fact that @xmath141 consists of two parts as @xmath166 eq.([eq : gm20ist0 ] ) dictates that @xmath167 since it also holds that ( the momentum sum rule ) @xmath168 it immediately follows that @xmath169 which is interpreted as showing the absence of the _ net quark contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon_.    finally , we investigate the forward limit of the isovector combination of the generalized magnetic form factors . from eq .
( [ eq : mgivform ] ) , we get @xmath170 which reproduces the known expression of the isovector magnetic form factor of the nucleon in the cqsm . on the other hand , letting @xmath5 in ( [ eq : mg2ivform ] ) , we have @xmath171 as shown in @xcite , this sum rule can be recast into the form : @xmath172 where @xmath173 consists of two parts as @xmath174 here , the first part is given as a proton matrix element of the _ free field expression _ for the isovector total angular momentum operator of quark fields as @xmath175 with @xmath176 \ ,   \psi ( { \mbox{\boldmath$x$ } } ) \,d^3 x \nonumber \\   & = & \hat{l}_f^{(i = 1 ) } + \frac{1}{2 } \,\hat{\sigma}^{(i = 1 ) } .\end{aligned}\ ] ] on the other hand ,
the second term is given as @xmath177 | n \rangle .\ ] ]
the model in the chiral limit contains two parameters , the weak pion decay constant @xmath178 and the dynamical quark mass @xmath11 . as usual , @xmath178 is fixed to its physical value , i.e. @xmath179 . for the mass parameter @xmath11 , there is some argument based on the instanton liquid picture of the qcd vacuum that it is not extremely far from @xmath180 @xcite .
the previous phenomenological analysis of various static baryon observables based on this model prefer a slightly larger value of @xmath11 between @xmath180 and @xmath181 @xcite@xcite . in the present analysis ,
we use the value @xmath182 . with this value of @xmath182 , we prepare self - consistent soliton solutions for seven values of @xmath183 , i.e. @xmath184 and @xmath185 , in order to see the pion mass dependence of the generalized form factors etc .
favorable physical predictions of the model will be obtained by using the value of @xmath182 and @xmath186 , since this set gives a self - consistent soliton solution close to the phenomenologically successful one obtained with @xmath187 and @xmath188 in the single - subtraction pauli - villars regularization scheme @xcite@xcite .
we first show in fig.[fig : profile ] the soliton profile functions @xmath52 obtained with several values of @xmath183 , i.e. @xmath189 , and @xmath185 .
one sees that the spatial size of the soliton profile becomes more and more compact as the pion mass increases .     and
@xmath190 , and @xmath185.,width=340,height=264 ]    we are now ready to show the theoretical predictions of the cqsm for the generalized form factors .
since the corresponding lattice predictions are given for the generalized form factors @xmath191 and @xmath192 , which are the generalization of the standard dirac and pauli form factors , we first write down the relations between these form factors and the generalized sachs - type factors , which we have calculated in the cqsm .
they are given by @xmath193 \,/\ , ( 1 + \tau ) , \\

we recall that @xmath196 and @xmath197 are nothing but the standard dirac and pauli form factors of the nucleon : @xmath198    since the lattice simulations by the lhpc and qcdsf collaborations were carried out in the heavy pion region around @xmath199 and since the simulation in the small pion mass region is hard to perform , we think it interesting to investigate the pion mass dependence of the generalized form factors within the framework of the cqsm . for simplicity
, we shall show the pion mass dependence of the generalized form factors at the zero momentum transfer only .
we think it enough for our purpose because the generalized form factors at the zero momentum transfer contain the most important information for clarifying the underlying spin structure of the nucleon . at zero momentum transfer ,
the relations between the generalized dirac and pauli form factors and the generalized sachs - type form factors are simplified to become @xmath200 and @xmath201     and @xmath202 as functions of @xmath183 ( the filled diamonds ) , together with the corresponding lattice predictions . here
, the open triangles correspond to the predictions of the lhpc group @xcite , while the open squares to those of the qcdsf collaboration @xcite.,width=604,height=264 ]    fig.[fig : a1020is ] shows the predictions of the cqsm for @xmath203 and @xmath202 as functions of @xmath183 , together with the corresponding lattice predictions . as for @xmath203 ,
the cqsm predictions and the lattice qcd predictions are both independent of @xmath183 and consistent with the constraint of the quark number sum rule : @xmath204 with high numerical precision . turning to @xmath202 ,
one finds a sizable difference between the predictions of the cqsm and of the lattice qcd .
the lattice qcd predicts that @xmath205 which means that only about @xmath206 of the total nucleon momentum is carried by the quark fields , while the rest is borne by the gluon fields . on the other hand , the cqsm predictions for the same quantity
is @xmath207 which means that the quark fields saturates the total nucleon momentum .
this may certainly be a limitation of an effective quark model , which contains no explicit gluon fields .
note , however , that the total quark momentum fraction @xmath202 is a scale dependent quantity .
the lattice result corresponds to the energy scale of @xmath208 @xcite , while the cqsm prediction should be taken as that of the model energy scale around @xmath209 @xcite .
we shall later make more meaningful comparison by taking care of the scale dependencies of relevant observables .     and
@xmath210 as functions of @xmath183 , together with the corresponding lattice predictions @xcite,@xcite .
the meaning of the symbols are the same as in fig.[fig : a1020is].,width=604,height=264 ]    next , in fig.[fig : a1020iv ] , we show the isovector combination of the generalized form factors @xmath211 and @xmath210 .
the meaning of the symbols are the same as in fig.[fig : a1020is ] . as for @xmath211 ,
both the cqsm and the lattice simulation reproduce the quark number sum rule @xmath212 with good prediction . turning to @xmath210
, one observes that the prediction of the cqsm shows somewhat peculiar dependence on the pion mass .
starting from a fairly small value in the chiral limit ( @xmath213 ) , it first increases as @xmath183 increases , but as @xmath183 further increases it begins to decrease , thereby showing a tendency to match the lattice prediction in the heavy pion region . very interestingly , letting put aside the absolute value , a similar @xmath183 dependence is also observed in the chiral extrapolation of the lattice prediction for the momentum fraction @xmath214 shown in fig.25 of @xcite .
physically , the quantity @xmath210 has a meaning of the difference of the momentum fractions carried by the @xmath69-quark and the @xmath70-quark .
the empirical value for it is @xmath215 @xcite .
one sees that the prediction of the cqsm in the chiral limit is not far from this empirical information , although more serious comparison must take account of the scale dependence of @xmath216 .     and @xmath217 as functions of @xmath183 , together with the corresponding lattice predictions @xcite,@xcite .
the meaning of the symbols are the same as in fig.[fig : a1020is].,width=604,height=264 ]    next , shown in fig.[fig : b1020is ] are the cqsm predictions for @xmath218 and @xmath217 .
the former quantity is related to the isoscalar combination of the nucleon anomalous magnetic moment as @xmath219 .
( we recall that its empirical value is @xmath220 . )
we find that this quantity is very sensitive to the variation of the pion mass .
it appears that the cqsm prediction @xmath221 corresponding to chiral limit underestimates the observation significantly .
however , the difference is exaggerated too much in this comparison . in fact
, if we carry out a comparison in the total isoscalar magnetic moment of the nucleon @xmath222 , the cqsm in the chiral limit gives @xmath223 in comparison with the observed value @xmath224 . to our knowledge ,
no theoretical predictions are given for this quantity by either of the lhpc or qcdsf collaborations .
the right panel of fig.4 shows the predictions for @xmath217 , which is sometimes called the isoscalar part of the nucleon anomalous gravitomagnetic moment , or alternatively the _ net quark contribution to the nucleon anomalous gravitomagnetic moment_. as already pointed out , the prediction of the cqsm for this quantity is exactly zero : i.e. @xmath169 the explicit numerical calculation also confirms it .
it should be recognized that the above result @xmath225 obtained in the cqsm is just a necessary consequence of the _ momentum sum rule _ and the _ total nucleon spin sum rule _
, both of which are saturated by the quark field only in the cqsm as @xmath226 and @xmath227   \ = \ \langle j \rangle^{u + d } \ = \
\frac{1}{2 } .\ ] ] in real qcd , the gluon also contributes to these sum rules , thereby leading to more general identities : @xmath228    + [ a_{20}^g ( 0 ) + b_{20}^g ( 0 ) ] = 1 , \end{aligned}\ ] ] which constrains that only the sum of @xmath217 and @xmath229 is forced to vanish as @xmath230 ( while we neglect here the contributions of other quarks than the @xmath69- and @xmath70-quarks , it loses no generality in our discussion below .
in fact , to include them , we have only to replace the combination @xmath231 by @xmath232 . )
the above nontrivial identity claims that the net contributions of quark and gluon fields to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon must be zero .
an interesting question is whether the quark and gluon contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment vanishes separately or they are both large with opposite sign .
a perturbative analysis based on a very simple toy model indicates the latter possibility @xcite . on the other hand
, a nonperturbative analysis within the framework of the lattice qcd indicates that the net quark contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment is small or nearly zero , @xmath233 @xcite,@xcite .
( to be more precise , we sees that the prediction of the lhpc collaboration for @xmath217 is slightly negative @xcite , while that of the qcdsf group is slightly positive @xcite . )
this strongly indicates a surprising possibility that the quark and gluon contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon may separately vanish .
worthy of special mention here is an interesting argument given by teryaev some years ago , claiming that the vanishing net quark contributions to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon , violated in perturbation theory , is expected to be restored in full nonperturbative qcd due to the confinement @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . very interestingly ,
once it actually happens , it leads to a surprisingly simple result , i.e. the proportionality of the quark momentum and angular momentum fraction @xmath234 as advocated by teryaev @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .
a far reaching physical consequence resulting from this observation was extensively discussed in our recent report @xcite .
( see also the discussion at the end of this section . )     and @xmath235 as functions of @xmath183 , together with the corresponding lattice predictions @xcite,@xcite .
the meaning of the symbols are the same as in fig.[fig : a1020is].,width=604,height=264 ]    next , we show in fig.[fig : b1020iv ] the predictions for the isovector case , i.e. @xmath236 and @xmath235 .
we recall first that the quantity @xmath236 represents the isovector combination of the nucleon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath237 , the empirical value of which is known to be @xmath238 .
one find that this quantity is extremely sensitive to the variation of the pion mass especially near @xmath239 .
this is only natural if one remembers the important role of the pion cloud in the isovector magnetic moment of the nucleon .
( one may notice that the prediction of the cqsm for @xmath240 underestimates a little its empirical value even in the chiral limit .
we recall , however , that , within the framework of the cqsm , there is an important @xmath241 correction or the 1st order rotational correction to some kind of isovector quantities like the isovector magnetic moment of the nucleon in question or the axial - vector coupling constant of the nucleon @xcite@xcite .
this next - to - leading correction in @xmath241 should also be taken into account in more advanced investigations . )
shown in the right panel of fig.[fig : b1020iv ] is the theoretical predictions for @xmath235 , the half of which can be interpreted as the difference of the total angular momentum carried by the @xmath69-quark and the @xmath70-quark fields according to ji s angular momentum sum rule @xcite .
the cqsm predicts fairly small value for this quantity , in contrast to the lattice predictions of sizable magnitude .
it seems that the pion mass dependence rescues this discrepancy only partially .
here we argue that , the reason why the cqsm ( in the chiral limit ) gives rather small prediction for this quantity is intimately connected with the characteristic @xmath1 dependence of the quantity @xmath242 , the forward limit of the isovector unpolarized spin - flip gpd of the nucleon . to show it
, we first recall that , within the theoretical frame work of the cqsm , @xmath236 as well as @xmath243 are calculated as difference of @xmath244 and @xmath245 and of @xmath246 and @xmath247 , respectively , as @xmath248 although the quantities of the rhs can be calculated directly without recourse to any distribution functions , they can also be evaluated as @xmath1-weighted integrals of the corresponding gpds as @xmath249 the distribution function @xmath242 has already been calculated within the cqsm in our recent paper @xcite . as shown there ,
the dirac sea contribution to this quantity has a sizably large peak around @xmath250 .
since this significant peak due to the deformed dirac - sea quarks is approximately symmetric with respect to the reflection @xmath251 , it hardly contributes to the second moment @xmath252 , whereas it gives a sizable contribution to the first moment @xmath253 .
the predicted significant peak of @xmath242 around @xmath250 can physically be interpreted as the effects of pion cloud .
it can be convinced in several ways .
first , we investigate how this behavior of @xmath242 changes as the pion mass is varied .
obtained with @xmath182 and @xmath239.,width=340,height=264 ]     dependence of @xmath254.,width=604,height=264 ]    shown in fig.[fig : eiv_pi0 ] and in fig.[fig : eiv_pi24 ] are the cqsm predictions for @xmath242 with several values of @xmath183 .
i.e. @xmath255 , and @xmath256 .
one clearly sees that the height of the peak around @xmath250 , due to the deformed dirac - sea quarks , decreases rapidly as @xmath183 increases .
this supports our interpretation of this peak as the effects of pion clouds . on the other hand
, one also observes that the magnitude of the valence quark contribution , peaked around @xmath257 , gradually increases as @xmath183 becomes large .
this behavior of @xmath242 turns out to cause a somewhat unexpected @xmath183 dependence of @xmath253 and @xmath252 . as a function of @xmath183 , the dirac sea contribution to
@xmath253 decreases fast , whereas the valence quark contribution to it increases slowly , so that the total @xmath253 becomes a decreasing function of @xmath183 . on the other hand ,
owing to the approximate odd - function nature of the dirac sea contribution to @xmath258 with respect to @xmath1 , it hardly contributes to @xmath259 independent of the pion mass , while the valence quark contribution to @xmath258 is an increasing function of @xmath183 , thereby leading to the result that the net @xmath259 is a increasing function of @xmath183 .
obtained with @xmath182 and @xmath239.,width=340,height=264 ]     dependence of @xmath260.,width=604,height=264 ]    we can give still another support to the above - mentioned interpretation of the contribution of the dirac - sea quarks . to see it ,
we first recall that the theoretical unpolarized distribution function @xmath261 appearing in the decomposition @xmath262 also has a sizable peak around @xmath250 due to the deformed dirac - sea quarks . as shown in fig.[fig : fiv_pi0 ] and in fig.[fig : fiv_pi24 ] , this peak is again a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath183 , supporting our interpretation of it as the effects of pion clouds . here
, we can say more .
we point out that this small-@xmath1 behavior of @xmath261 is just what is required by the famous nmc measurement @xcite . to confirm it ,
first remember that the distribution @xmath263 in the negative @xmath1 region should actually be interpreted as the distribution of antiquarks . to be explicit
, it holds that @xmath264 the large and positive value of @xmath261 in the negative @xmath1 region close to @xmath250 means that @xmath265 is negative , i.e. the dominance of the @xmath7-quark over the @xmath8-quark inside the proton , which has been established by the nmc measurement @xcite
.     evolved to @xmath266 and @xmath267 in comparison with the hermes and nutev data at the corresponding energy scales @xcite,@xcite.,width=340,height=283 ]    shown in fig.[fig : dbdu ] are the predictions of the cqsm for @xmath268 evolved to the high energy scales corresponding to the experimental observation @xcite .
( the theoretical predictions here were obtained with @xmath182 and @xmath269 . )
the model reproduces well the observed behavior of @xmath268 , although the magnitude of the flavor asymmetry in smaller @xmath1 region seems to be slightly overestimated .
it is a widely accepted fact that this flavor asymmetry of the sea quark distribution in the proton can physically be understood as the effects of pion cloud at least qualitatively @xcite@xcite .
this then supports our interpretation of the effects of the deformed dirac - sea quarks in @xmath242 and @xmath261 as the effects of pion clouds .    .the
@xmath270 dependencies of @xmath271 , @xmath272 , and @xmath273 in the cqsm with @xmath182 .
[ tabivb20 ] [ cols="^,^,^,^",options="header " , ]
in this paper , we have investigated the generalized form factors of the nucleon , which will be extracted through near - future measurements of the generalized parton distribution functions , within the framework of the cqsm .
a particular emphasis is put on the pion mass dependence as well as the scale dependence of the model predictions , which we compare with the corresponding predictions of the lattice qcd by the lhpc and the qcdsf collaborations carried out in the heavy pion regime around @xmath199 .
the generalized form factors contain the ordinary electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon such as the dirac and pauli form factors of the proton and the neutron .
we have shown that the cqsm with good chiral symmetry reproduces well the general behaviors of the observed electromagnetic form factors , while the lattice simulations by the above two groups have a tendency to underestimate the electromagnetic sizes of the nucleon . undoubtedly , this can not be unrelated to the fact that the above two lattice simulations were performed with unrealistically heavy pion mass .
we have also tried to figure out the underlying spin contents of the nucleon through the analysis of the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic form factors of the nucleon , by taking care of the pion mass despondencies as well as of the scale dependencies of the relevant quantities . after taking account of the scale dependencies by means of the qcd evolution equations at the nlo in the @xmath274 scheme ,
the cqsm predicts , at @xmath275 , that @xmath276 , and @xmath277 , which means that the quark orbital angular momentum carries sizable amount of total nucleon spin even at such a relatively high energy scale .
it contradicts the conclusion of the lhpc and qcdsf collaborations indicating that the total orbital angular momentum of quarks is very small or consistent with zero .
it should be recognized , however , that the prediction of the cqsm for the total quark angular momentum is not extremely far from the corresponding lattice prediction @xmath278 at the same renormalization scale .
the cause of discrepancy can therefore be traced back to the lhpc and qcdsf lattice qcd predictions for the quark spin fraction @xmath279 around 0.6 , which contradicts not only the prediction of the cqsm but also the emc observation . as was shown in our recent paper @xcite , @xmath279 is such a quantity that is extremely sensitive to the variation of the pion mass , especially in the region close to the chiral limit .
more serious lattice qcd studies on the @xmath270-dependence of @xmath279 is highly desirable .
worthy of special mention is the fact that , once we accept a theoretical postulate @xmath280 , i.e , the absence of the net quark contribution to the anomalous gravitomagnetic moment of the nucleon , which is supported by both of the lhpc and qcdsf lattice simulations , we are necessarily led to a surprisingly simple relations , @xmath281 and @xmath282 , i.e. the proportionality of the linear and angular momentum fractions carried by the quarks and the gluons . using these relations , together with the existing empirical information for the unpolarized and the longitudinally polarized pdfs
, we can give _ model - independent predictions _ for the quark and gluon contents of the nucleon spin .
for instance , with combined use of the mrst2004 fit @xcite and the dns2005 fit @xcite , we obtain @xmath283 , @xmath284 , and @xmath285 at @xmath275 . since @xmath286 ( as well as @xmath287 ) is a rapidly decreasing function of the energy scale , while the scale dependence of @xmath279 is very weak
, we must conclude that the former is even more dominant over the latter at the scale below @xmath288 where any low energy models are supposed to hold .
the situation is a little more complicated in the flavor - nonsinglet ( or isovector ) channel , because @xmath289 , and also because the cqsm and the lattice qcd give fairly different predictions for @xmath271 . as compared with the lattice prediction for @xmath271 around @xmath290 , the predictions of the cqsm turns out to be around @xmath291 .
we have argued that the relatively small value of @xmath246 obtained in the cqsm is intimately connected with the small @xmath1 enhancement of the generalized parton distribution @xmath292 , which is dominated by the clouds of pionic @xmath293 excitation around @xmath294 .
( we recall that the 2nd moment of @xmath292 gives @xmath246 . )
unfortunately , such a @xmath1-dependent distribution as @xmath292 can not be accessed within the framework of lattice qcd .
still , the predicted small @xmath1 behavior of @xmath295 as well as of @xmath296 indicates again the importance of chiral dynamics in the nucleon structure function physics , which has not been fully accounted for in the lattice qcd simulation at the present level .

here we closely follow the proof of the momentum sum rule given in @xcite , by taking into account a necessary modification in the case of @xmath297 .
the starting point is the following expression for the soliton mass ( or the static soliton energy ) : @xmath298   \ - \ ( h \rightarrow h_0 ) \ + \
e_m , \ ] ] with @xmath299 \ = \ - \,f_\pi^2 \,m_\pi^2 \,\int \ , [   \cos f(r ) - 1 ] \,d^3 x .
\label{eq : emeson}\ ] ] the soliton mass must be stationary with respect to an arbitrary variation of the chiral field @xmath300 or equivalently the soliton profile @xmath52 , which lead to a saddle point equation : @xmath301    \ + \ \delta e_m \ = \ 0 .\ ] ] here we consider a particular ( dilatational ) variation of chiral field @xmath302 for infinitesimal @xmath3 , we have @xmath303 so that @xmath304   \ = \ \xi \ , ( [ x^k \partial_k , h ] - i \gamma^0 \gamma^k \partial_k ) .\end{aligned}\ ] ] noting the identity @xmath305 ) \ =
\    \mbox{sp } ( [ h , \theta ( e_0 - h + i \varepsilon ) ] x^k \partial_k )   \ = \ 0 , \end{aligned}\ ] ] we therefore obtain a key identity @xmath306 = - \,\delta e_m .
\label{eq : keyid}\ ] ] now , by using ( [ eq : emeson ] ) together with the relations , @xmath307 we get @xmath308 here , taking account of the boundary condition @xmath309 we can manipulate as @xmath310 we thus find an important relation : @xmath311 putting this relation into ( [ eq : keyid ] ) , we have @xmath312 or @xmath313 if we evaluate the trace sum above by using the eigenstates of the static dirac hamiltonian @xmath50 as a complete set of basis , ( [ eq : traceap ] ) can also be written as @xmath314 which is the relation quoted in ( [ eq : alfp ] ) .
we point out that our result has a correct chiral limit , since @xmath315 as @xmath316 and therefore @xmath317 in conformity with the proof given in ref.@xcite .
