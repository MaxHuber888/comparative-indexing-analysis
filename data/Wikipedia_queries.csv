What are some applications of SNNs?,"SNNs can apply to the same applications as traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), and in addition, they can model the central nervous system of biological organisms. However, a lack of effective training mechanisms for SNNs can be inhibitory for some applications, like computer vision tasks. ",Spiking neural network.txt
What developments have improved the efficiency and computational power of SNNs?,"Incorporating additional neuron dynamics like Spike Frequency Adaptation (SFA) into neuron models is one such development. SFA offers computational benefits by reducing power usage and increasing coding efficiency, especially in repetitive or intense stimuli. This adaptation also enhances signal clarity and introduces short-term memory at the neuron level, refining information processing accuracy and efficiency.",Spiking neural network.txt
What is the Unified Modeling Language (UML)? ,"The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose visual modeling language that provides a standard way to visualize the design of a system. It offers a standard notation for many types of diagrams which can be roughly categorized into behavior diagrams, interaction diagrams, and structure diagrams.",Unified Modeling Language.txt
What was the motivation behind the creation of UML? ,The creation of UML was primarily motivated by the desire to standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software design. ,Unified Modeling Language.txt
When and by whom was UML developed? ,"UML was developed at Rational Software in 1994–1995, with further development led by them through 1996. ",Unified Modeling Language.txt
Who manages UML and when was it adopted as a standard? ,"UML was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG) in 1997 and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005, UML was also published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as the ISO/IEC 19501 standard.",Unified Modeling Language.txt
What are the main groups that UML diagrams can be divided into?,"UML diagrams can be largely divided into three main groups: behavior diagrams, interaction diagrams, and structure diagrams.",Unified Modeling Language.txt
